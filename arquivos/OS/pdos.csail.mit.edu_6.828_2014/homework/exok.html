<h1>Homework: OS Organization</h1>

<p> Submit your answer before the beginning of the lecture to <a
 href="https://ccutler.scripts.mit.edu/6.828/handin.py/">the submission web site</a>.

<p>This lecture will provide an introduction to operating system organizations,
monolythic, microkernel, etc.  The assigned paper describes the exokernel
organization.  The JOS operating system you are building in the labs is
organized like an exokernel.

<div class="required">
<p><b>Submit</b>: In lab 4 you completed building the core of an
exokernel-based operating system.  In class you studied xv6, a
monolithic operating systems.  Both are intend to support the UNIX
API, but their internal organizations are different.  A good example
is the virtual memory implementation: JOS implements many
virtual-memory-related functions (such as <tt>fork</tt>) in its
library operating system, while xv6 implements them in the kernel.
Give an concrete example of what a user program could do in JOS that a
user-level program on xv6 is unable to do and why it is useful.
