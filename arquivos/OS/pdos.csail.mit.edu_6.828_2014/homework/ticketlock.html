<h1>Homework: Spin Lock Alternatives</h1>

<p> Submit your answer before the beginning of the lecture to <a
 href="https://ccutler.scripts.mit.edu/6.828/handin.py/">the submission web site</a>.

<div class="question"> <p><b>Submit</b>: The ticket lock is slightly different
than the spinlock in in JOS and xv6.  Assuming an invalidation-based coherence
scheme as described in the paper,  does a ticket lock introduce less inter-CPU
  communication than a JOS/xv6 spinlock?
