<h1>Homework: xv6 system calls</h1>

<p>Submit your solutions before the beginning of the next lecture to the <a
 href="https://ccutler.scripts.mit.edu/6.828/handin.py/">submission web site</a>.

<p>
This homework requres recent code; please update your xv6 repo:
<pre>
athena% <kbd>cd ~/6.828/xv6</kbd>
athena% <kbd>git pull</kbd>
</pre>
If you have any local changes, you may need to commit them before pulling.
</p>

<h2>Part One: System call tracing</h2>

Your first task is to modify the xv6 kernel to print out a line for
each system call invocation. It is enough to print the name of the
system call and the return value; you don't need to print the system
call arguments.

<p>
When you're done, you should see output like this when booting
xv6:

<pre>
...
fork -> 2
exec -> 0
open -> 3
close -> 0
$write -> 1
 write -> 1
</pre>

<p>
That's init forking and execing sh, sh making sure only two file
descriptors are open, and sh writing the $ prompt.

<p>
Hint: modify the syscall() function in syscall.c.

<p>
Challenge: print the system call arguments.

<h2>Part Two: Date system call</h2>

Your second task is to add a new system call to xv6. The main point of
the exercise is for you to see some of the different pieces of the
system call machinery.

Your new system call will get the current UTC time and return it to the user
program. You may want to use the helper function, <tt>cmostime()</tt>
(defined in <tt>lapic.c</tt>), to read the real time clock. <tt>date.h</tt>
contains the definition of the <tt>struct rtcdate</tt> struct, which you will
provide as an argument to <tt>cmostime()</tt> as a pointer.

<p>
You should create a user-level program that calls your new date system
call; here's some source you should put in <tt>date.c</tt>:

<pre>
#include "types.h"
#include "user.h"
#include "date.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  struct rtcdate r;

  if (date(&r)) {
    printf(2, "date failed\n");
    exit();
  }

  // your code to print the time in any format you like...

  exit();
}
</pre>

<p>
In order to make your new <tt>date</tt> program available to run from
the xv6 shell, add <tt>_date</tt> to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> definition
in <tt>Makefile</tt>.

<p>
Your strategy for making a date system call should be to clone all of
the pieces of code that are specific to some existing system call, for
example the "uptime" system call. You should grep for uptime in all
the source files, using <tt>grep -n uptime *.[chS]</tt>.

<p>
When you're done, typing <tt>date</tt> to an xv6 shell prompt
should print the current UTC time.

<p>
Write down a few words of explanation for each of the files you had
to modify in the process of creating your date system call.

<p>
Challenge: add a dup2() system call.

<p>
<div class="question">
<p><b>Submit</b>: Your explanations of the modifications for date in a file
named hwN.txt where N is the homework number as posted on the schedule.
