<h1>Homework: radixvm question</h1>

<p> Submit your answer before the beginning of the lecture to <a
 href="https://ccutler.scripts.mit.edu/6.828/handin.py/">the submission web site</a>.

<div class="question"> <p><b>Submit</b>: Refcache re-examines the reference
  count of an object <i>two</i> epochs later after it inserts the object in a per-core
  review queue (see page 4, 2nd paragraph, right column).  What goes wrong if
  refcache reviews objects only <i>one</i> epoch later?  Is two epochs later just more
  efficient or is it necessary for correctness?  (Briefly explain your answer.)
