<h1>Homework: shell</h1>

<p>sh.c

<pre>
ls > y
cat < y | sort | uniq | wc > y1
cat y1
rm y1
ls |  sort | uniq | wc
rm y
</pre>
Cut and paste these commands into a file <tt>t.sh</tt>

<p>To compile <tt>sh.c</tt>, you need a C compiler, such as gcc.  On Athena, you
can type:
<pre>
$ add gnu
</pre>
to make gcc available.
If you are using your own computer, you may have to install gcc.

<p>Once you have a gcc, you can compile the skeleton shell as follows:
<pre>
$ gcc sh.c
</pre>
which produce an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which you can run:
<pre>
$ ./a.out < t.sh
</pre>
This execution will print error messages because you have not implemented several features. In
the rest of this assignment you will implement those features.

<h2>Executing simple commands</h2>

<p>Implement simple commands, such as:
<pre>
$ ls
</pre>

<p> The parser already builds an <tt>execcmd</tt> for you, so the only code you
have to write is for the ' ' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>. You might find it useful
to look at the manual page for exec; type "man 3 exec", and read about
<tt>execv</tt>.  Print an error message when exec fails.

<p>To test your program, compile and run the resulting a.out:
<pre>
6.828$./a.out
</pre>

This prints a prompt and waits for input.  <tt>sh.c</tt> prints as prompt
<tt>6.828$</tt> so that you don't get confused with your computer's shell.

Now type to your shell:
<pre>
6.828$ ls
</pre>

<p>Your shell should print an error message (unless there is a program named
<tt>ls</tt> in your working directory).  Now type to your shell:

<pre>
6.828$ /bin/ls
</pre>

<p>This should execute the program <tt>/bin/ls</tt>, which should print out the
file names in your working directory.  You can stop the 6.828 shell by tying
ctrl-d, which should put you back in your computer's shell.

<p>You may want to change the 6.828 shell to always try <tt>/bin</tt>, if the program
doesn't exist in the current working directory, so that below you don't have to
type "/bin" for each program.  If you are ambitious you can implement support
for a <tt>PATH</tt> variable.

<h2>I/O redirection</h2>

<p>Implement I/O redirection commands so that you can run:
<pre>echo "6.828 is cool" > x.txt
cat < x.txt
</pre>

<p>The parser already recognizes ">" and "<", and builds a <tt>redircmd</tt> for
you, so your job is just filling out the missing code in <tt>runcmd</tt> for
those symbols. You might find the man pages for open and close useful

<p>Make sure you print an error message if one of the system calls you are using fails.

<p>Make sure your implementation runs correctly with the above test input.  A
common error is to forget to specify the permission with which the file must be
created (i.e., the 3rd argument to open).

<h2>Implement pipes</h2>

<p>Implement pipes so that you can run command pipelines such as:
<pre>
$ ls | sort | uniq | wc
</pre>

<p>The parser already recognizes "|", and builds a <tt>pipecmd</tt> for you, so
the only code you must write is for the '|' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>.  You might
find the man pages for pipe, fork, close, and dup useful.

<p>Test that you can run the above pipeline. The <tt>sort</tt> program may be in
the directory <tt>/usr/bin/</tt> and in that case you can type the absolute
pathname <tt>/usr/bin/sort</tt> to run sort.  (In your computer's shell you can
type <tt>which sort</tt> to find out which directory in the shell's search path
has an executable named "sort".)

<p>Now you should be able the following command correctly:
<pre>
6.828$ a.out < t.sh
</pre>

<p>Make sure you use the right absolute pathnames for the programs.

<p>Don't forget to submit your solution to the <a href="https://ccutler.scripts.mit.edu/6.828/handin.py/">submission web site</a>, with or without
challenge solutions.

<h2>Challenge exercises</h2>

<p>You can add any feature of your choice to your shell.  But, you may want consider
the following as a start:
<ul>
<li> Implement lists of commands, separated by ";"
<li> Implement sub shells by implementing "(" and ")"
<li> Implement running commands in the background by supporting "&" and "wait"
</ul>
All of these require making changing to the parser and the <tt>runcmd</tt>
function.
