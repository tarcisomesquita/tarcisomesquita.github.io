telinit may be used to change the runlevel of the system.

comando
telinit RUNLEVEL

RUNLEVEL
2-5: multi-user
0: halt the system
6: reboot the system
1: to bring the system down into single-user mode.
S or s: place the system directly into single-user mode without actually stopping  processes  first.

Runlevels 2 through 5 get all six virtual consoles, while runlevel 1 (single user mode) gets only one and runlevels 0 and 6 get none.

The /sbin/mingetty process opens communication pathways to tty devices, sets their modes, prints the login prompt, gets the user name, and initiates the login process for the user.
