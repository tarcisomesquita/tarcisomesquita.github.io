kernel se descomprime
configures the computer's memory
configures the various hardware attached to the system, including all processors, I/O subsystems, and storage devices.

It then looks for the compressed initrd image in a predetermined location in memory, decompresses it, mounts it

the kernel converts initrd into a "normal" RAM disk (/dev/ram0)
the initrd image is then mounted as root
/sbin/init is executed with UID 0

cat /var/log/kern.log | grep -i RAMDISK
