When control is handed to your UEFI application by firmware, it sets a watchdog timer for 5 minutes, after which the firmware is reinvoked as it assumes your application has hung.
you can disable it completely with code like

SystemTable->BootServices->SetWatchdogTimer(0, 0, 0, NULL);

My bootloader hangs if I change EFI_MEMORY_TYPE values
bug: values above 0x80000000 = 2 GiB
