***Linux:***  
1. Download and extract or clone this repository into a dedicated folder, preferably somewhere easy like ~/BareMetalx64

2. If, in the terminal, "gcc --version" reports GCC 8.0.0 or later and "ld --version" reports 2.29.1 or later, do steps 2a, 2b, and 2c. Otherwise go to step 3.

    2a. Type "which gcc" in the terminal, and make a note of what it says (something like /usr/bin/gcc or /usr/local/bin/gcc)

    2b. Open Compile.sh in an editor of your choice (nano, gedit, vim, etc.) and set the GCC_FOLDER_NAME variable at the top to be the part before "bin" (e.g. /usr or /usr/local, without the last slash). Do the same thing for BINUTILS_FOLDER_NAME, except use the output of "which ld" to get the directory path preceding "bin" instead.

    2c. Now set the terminal to the Simple-UEFI-Bootloader folder and run "./Compile.sh", which should work and output BOOTX64.EFI in the Backend folder. *That's it!*

3. Looks like we need to build GCC & Binutils. Navigate to the "Backend" folder in terminal and do "git clone git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git" there. This will download a copy of the latest GCC, which is necessary for "static-pie" support (when combined with Binutils 2.29.1 or later, it allows  statically-linked, position-independent executables to be created; earlier versions do not). If that git link ever changes, you'll need to find wherever the official GCC git repository ran off to.

4. Once GCC has been cloned, in the cloned folder do "contrib/download_prerequisites" and then "./configure -v --build=x86_64-linux-gnu --host=x86_64-linux-gnu --target=x86_64-linux-gnu --prefix=$PWD/../gcc-8 --enable-checking=release --enable-languages=c --disable-multilib"

    NOTE: If you want, you can enable other languages like c++, fortran, objective-c (objc), go, etc. with enable-languages. You can also change the name of the folder it will built into by changing --prefix=[desired folder]. The above command line will configure GCC to be made in a folder called gcc-8 inside the "Backend" folder. Be aware that --prefix requires an absolute path.

5. After configuration completes, do "make -j [twice the number of cores of your CPU]" and go eat lunch. Unfortunately, sometimes building the latest GCC produces build-time errors; I ran into an "aclocal-1.15" issue when building via Linux on Windows (fixed by installing the latest version of Ubuntu on Windows and using the latest autoconf).

6. Now just do "make install" and GCC will be put into the gcc-8 folder from step 4.

7. Next, grab binutils 2.29.1 or later from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/ and extract the archive to Backend.

8. In the extracted Binutils folder, do "mkdir build" and "cd build" before configuring with "../configure --prefix=$PWD/../binutils-binaries --enable-gold --enable-ld=default --enable-plugins --enable-shared --disable-werror"

    NOTE: The "prefix" flag means the same thing as GCC's.

9. Once configuration is finished, do "make -j [twice the number of CPU cores]" and go have dinner.

10. Once make is done making, do "make -k check" and do a crossword or something. There should be a very small number of errors, if any.

11. Finally, do "make install" to install the package into binutils-binaries. Congratulations, you've just built some of the biggest Linux sources ever! You can also safely delete the folders that were created by the cloning process now--they'll be several GBs at this point.

12. Open Compile.sh in an editor of your choice (nano, gedit, vim, etc.) and set the GCC_FOLDER_NAME variable at the top (e.g. gcc-8 without any slashes). Do the same thing for the BINUTILS_FOLDER_NAME, except use the binutils-binaries folder.

13. At long last, you should be able to run "./Compile.sh" from within the "Simple-UEFI-Bootloader" folder.

    *That's it! It should compile and a binary called "BOOTX64.EFI" will be output into the "Backend" folder.*
