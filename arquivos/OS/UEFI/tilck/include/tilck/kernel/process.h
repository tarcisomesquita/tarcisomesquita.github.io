    * marked as ATOMIC here for consistency, as in interrupt context this member
    * might be checked and changed (see the tasklet subsystem).
    *
    * If, in the future `state` will need to become wider than just 1 single
    * byte, then even getting a plain atomicity would require ATOMIC(x) on some
    * architectures, while on i386 and x86_64 it won't make a difference.
    * Therefore, marking it ATOMIC at the moment is more about semantic than
    * anything else, but in the future it will be actually needed.

    * NOTE: the following implications are *not* true:
    *
    *    volatile -> atomic
    *    atomic -> volatile
    *
    * The field needs to be also volatile because its value is read in loops
    * expecting it to change as some point (see sys_waitpid()). Theoretically,
    * in case of consecutive atomic loads, the compiler is _not_ obliged to
    * do every time an actual read and it might cache the value in a register,
    * according to the C11 atomic model. In practice with GCC this can happen
    * only with relaxed atomics (the ones used in Tilck), at best of my
    * knowledge, but it is still good write C11 compliant code, instead of
    * relying on the current behavior.
