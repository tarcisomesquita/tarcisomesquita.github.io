The required Linux Kernel configuration options[2] for UEFI systems are:

CONFIG_EFI=y
CONFIG_EFI_STUB=y
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
CONFIG_X86_SYSFB=y
CONFIG_FB_SIMPLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
cat .config | egrep 'CONFIG_EFI=y|CONFIG_EFI_STUB=|CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=|CONFIG_X86_SYSFB=|CONFIG_FB_SIMPLE=|CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE='

CONFIG_EFIVAR_FS=y
mounted in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
can be edited with program efibootmgr

CONFIG_EFI_VARS=n
mounted in /sys/firmware/efi/vars
should be disabled to prevent any potential issues

CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y
GUID Partition Table (GPT)

CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y
to boot a x64_64 kernel on a IA32 UEFI


make menuconfig

steps from Documentation/x86/x86_64/uefi.rst
- Build the kernel with the following configuration::
	CONFIG_FB_EFI=y
	CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y

  If EFI runtime services are expected, the following configuration should be selected::
	CONFIG_EFI=y
	CONFIG_EFI_VARS=y or m		# optional

- Create a VFAT partition on the disk
- Copy the following to the VFAT partition:
	kernel image and initrd

- Boot to EFI shell

cat .config | egrep 'CONFIG_FB_EFI=|CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=|CONFIG_EFI=|CONFIG_EFI_VARS='
