Interrupt 15hâ€“Big Memory Services, Continued
NOTE: Each call of this service defines a descriptor buffer
and requests the memory status of the address range
specified by the continuation value, where zero = first address
range. The function fills the buffer and returns the continuation
value for the next address range, where zero = last
address range.
