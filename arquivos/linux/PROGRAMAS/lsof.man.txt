lsof - list open files

-a
used to AND the selections.  Example, lsof -a -U -ufoo list only UNIX socket files that belong to processes owned by user "foo".

-b
This option causes lsof to avoid kernel functions that might block - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).

-c c
list files for processes executing the command that begins with the string c.

+c w
maximum number of characters of the name to be printed in the COMMAND column. (The lsof default is nine.)

+d s
search all open instances of directory s and the files and directories it contains at its top level.

+D D
search all open instances of directory D and all the files and directories it contains to its complete depth.

-F f
selects the fields to be output.
Each field is a character in f.
See the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS
the character '?' display a help list of the field identification characters.

-i [i]
list files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i.
If no address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and x.25 (HP-UX) network files.
If -i4 or -i6 is specified with no following address, only files of the indicated IP version, IPv4 or IPv6, are displayed.

An Internet address is specified in the form (Items in square brackets are optional.):
[46][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:service|port]
protocol is a protocol name - TCP or UDP.
Service names and port numbers may be combined in a list whose entries are separated by commas and whose numeric range entries are separated by minus signs.
sample addresses:
TCP:25 - TCP and port 25
@1.2.3.4 - Internet IPv4 host address 1.2.3.4
@[3ffe:1ebc::1]:1234 - Internet IPv6 host address 3ffe:1ebc::1, port 1234
TCP@lsof.itap:513 - TCP, port 513 and host name lsof.itap
tcp@foo:1-10,smtp,99 - TCP, ports 1 through 10, service name smtp, port 99, host name foo
:time - either TCP or UDP time service port

+|-M
Enables (+) or disables (-) the reporting of portmapper registrations for local TCP and UDP ports.

-n
inhibits the conversion of network numbers to host names for network files.

-p s
list files for the processes whose PID are in the comma-separated set s, e.g., "123" or "123,^456".

-P
This  option inhibits the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files.

+|-r [t]
This option puts lsof in repeat mode.
delays t seconds (default fifteen), then repeats the listing.
If the prefix is a '-', repeat mode is endless.  Lsof must be terminated with an interrupt or quit signal.
If  the  prefix is '+', repeat mode will end the first cycle no open files are listed.

-R
list the PPID column.

-S [t]
This option specifies an optional time-out seconds value for kernel functions - lstat(2), readlink(2), and stat(2).
The minimum for t is two; the default is fifteen.

-T s
Report TCP connection state.

-t
Specifies that lsof should produce output with PID only, so that the output may be piped to program kill.

-u s
list files for the user whose login names or user ID numbers are in the comma-separated set s - e.g., "abe", or "548,root".
If a login name or user ID is preceded by a '^', it becomes a negation, e.g., "-u^root".

-U
list UNIX domain socket files.

+|-w
Enables (+) (default) or disables (-) the suppression of warning messages.

-x [fl]
This option may accompany the +d and +D options to direct their processing to cross over symbolic links and|or file system  mount  points
encountered when scanning the directory (+d) or directory tree (+D).
when -x is specified without a parameter, the next argument must begin with '-' or '+'.
'f' parameter enables file system mount point cross-over;
'l', symbolic link cross-over.
The -x option may not be supplied without also supplying a +d or +D option.

-X
skip the reporting of information on all open TCP and UDP IPv4 and IPv6 files.
processing of information in the /proc/net/tcp* and /proc/net/udp* files would take lsof a long time.


OUTPUT

FD
is the File Descriptor number of the file or:
       cwd  current working directory;

       tr   kernel trace file (OpenBSD);
       txt  program text (code and data);
       v86  VP/ix mapped file;

  FD is followed by one of these characters, describing the mode under which the file is open:

       r for read access;
       w for write access;
       u for read and write access;
       space if mode unknown and no lock character follows;
       '-' if mode unknown and lock character follows.

  The mode character is followed by one of these lock characters, describing the type of lock applied to the file:

       N for a Solaris NFS lock of unknown type;
       r for read lock on part of the file;
       R for a read lock on the entire file;
       w for a write lock on part of the file;
       W for a write lock on the entire file;
       u for a read and write lock of any length;

       X for an SCO OpenServer Xenix lock on the      entire file;
       space if there is no lock.

  See the LOCKS section for more information on the lock information character.

  The FD column contents constitutes a single field for parsing in post-processing scripts.

  "(ESTABLISHED)",  "(Unbound)"), queue sizes, and window sizes (not all dialects) - in a fashion similar to what netstat(1) reports;
  see the -T option description or the description of the TCP/TPI field in OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS for more information on state, queue
  size, and window size;

  or  the address or name of a UNIX domain socket, possibly including a stream clone device name, a file system object's path name, local

  sending  on  the  socket has been disabled, or ", CANTRCVMORE" if receiving on the socket has been disabled (e.g., by the shutdown(2)
  function);

For dialects  that  support  a  "namefs"  file  system,  allowing  one  file  to  be  attached  to  another  with  fattach(3C),  lsof  will  add
"(FA:<address1><direction><address2>)"  to  the  NAME  column.   <address1> and <address2> are hexadecimal vnode addresses.  <direction> will be
"<-" if <address2> has been fattach'ed to this vnode whose address is <address1>; and "->" if <address1>, the vnode address of this vnode, has
been fattach'ed to <address2>.  <address1> may be omitted if it already appears in the DEVICE column.

Lsof  may  add two parenthetical notes to the NAME column for open Solaris 10 files: "(?)" if lsof considers the path name of questionable accu-
racy; and "(deleted)" if the -X option has been specified and lsof detects the open file's path name has been deleted.   Consult  the  lsof  FAQ
(The FAQ section gives its location.)  for more information on these NAME column additions.
