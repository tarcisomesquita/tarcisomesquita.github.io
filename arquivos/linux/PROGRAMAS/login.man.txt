    Name of the remote host for this login.

CONFIGURATION
The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:

CONSOLE_GROUPS (string)
    List of groups to add to the user´s supplementary group set when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE setting). Default is
    none.

    Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.

DEFAULT_HOME (boolean)
    Indicate if login is allowed if we can´t cd to the home directory. Default in no.

    If set to yes, the user will login in the root (/) directory if it is not possible to cd to her home directory.

ENV_PATH (string)
    If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when a regular user login. The value can be preceded by PATH=, or a colon
    separated list of paths (for example /bin:/usr/bin). The default value is PATH=/bin:/usr/bin.

ENV_SUPATH (string)
    If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when the superuser login. The value can be preceded by PATH=, or a colon
    separated list of paths (for example /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin). The default value is PATH=/bin:/usr/bin.

ERASECHAR (number)
    Terminal ERASE character (010 = backspace, 0177 = DEL).

    The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for an hexadecimal value.

FAIL_DELAY (number)
    Delay in seconds before being allowed another attempt after a login failure.

FAKE_SHELL (string)
    If set, login will execute this shell instead of the users´ shell specified in /etc/passwd.

HUSHLOGIN_FILE (string)
    If defined, this file can inhibit all the usual chatter during the login sequence. If a full pathname is specified, then hushed mode will be
    enabled if the user´s name or shell are found in the file. If not a full pathname, then hushed mode will be enabled if the file exists in the
    user´s home directory.

KILLCHAR (number)
    Terminal KILL character (025 = CTRL/U).

    The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for an hexadecimal value.

LOGIN_RETRIES (number)
    Maximum number of login retries in case of bad password.

    This will most likely be overriden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module has it´s own built in of 3 retries. However, this is a safe
    fallback in case you are using an authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.

LOGIN_TIMEOUT (number)
    Max time in seconds for login.

LOG_OK_LOGINS (boolean)
    Enable logging of successful logins.

LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB (boolean)
    Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are recorded.

    Note: logging unknown usernames may be a security issue if an user enter her password instead of her login name.

TTYGROUP (string), TTYPERM (string)
    The terminal permissions: the login tty will be owned by the TTYGROUP group, and the permissions will be set to TTYPERM.

    By default, the ownership of the terminal is set to the user´s primary group and the permissions are set to 0600.


    TTYGROUP can be either the name of a group or a numeric group identifier.

    If you have a write program which is "setgid" to a special group which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group number and TTYPERM to
    0620. Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.

TTYTYPE_FILE (string)
    If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment parameter. Each line of the file is in a format something like "vt100 tty01".

USERGROUPS_ENAB (boolean)
