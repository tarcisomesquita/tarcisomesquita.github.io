DESCRIPTION

update
    update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list.

install
    install is followed by one or more packages desired for installation or upgrading.
    The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate the desired packages.

    A specific version of a package can be selected for installation by following the package name with an equals and the version of the
    package to select.

    If no package matches the given expression and the expression contains one of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX
    regular expression, and it is applied to all package names in the
    database. Any matches are then installed (or removed). Note that
    matching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo' and
    'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression with
    a '^' or '$' character, or create a more specific regular
    expression.

remove
    remove packages but leaves its configuration files in system.

purge
    remove packages (configuration files too).

source
    APT will examine the available packages to decide which source package to fetch.
    download into the current directory the newest available version of that source package

    Source packages are tracked from deb-src lines in the sources.list file.

    If --compile option is specified then the package will be compiled to a binary .deb using dpkg-buildpackage
    if --download-only is specified then the source package will not be unpacked.

    A specific source version can be retrieved by postfixing the source name with an equals and then the version to fetch

check
    check is a diagnostic tool; it updates the package cache and checks for broken dependencies.

clean
    clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.
    It removes everything in /var/cache/apt/archives/


OPTIONS
-d, --download-only
    Download only; package files are only retrieved, not unpacked or installed.

-f, --fix-broken
    attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies.

-s, --simulate, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon, --no-act
    No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur but do not actually change the system.

-b, --compile, --build
    Compile source packages after downloading them.

--print-uris
    Instead of fetching the files to install their URIs are printed.



FILES

/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/
    APT configuration file fragments. Configuration Item:
