SYNOPSIS
chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
chown changes the user and/or group ownership of each given file.
OWNER and GROUP can be a user name or numeric user ID.
If only an owner is given, that user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group is not changed.
If a colon but no group name follows the user name, the group of the files is changed to that user's login group.
If the colon and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; chown act like chgrp.

With --reference, change the owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

OPTIONS
--dereference
       affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default), rather than the symbolic link itself

-h, --no-dereference
       affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the ownership of a symlink)

--from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
       change the owner and/or group of each file only if its current owner and/or group match those specified here.

-f, --silent, --quiet
       suppress most error messages

-R, --recursive
       operate on files and directories recursively

The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.
-H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it
-L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered
-P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)
