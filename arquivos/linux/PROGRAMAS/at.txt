First, you'd type:

at 12:45

You will see:

warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
at >

Now you'd write the commands you want carried out.
Here we'll get the output of the command last, which tells us who's logged in to our servers lately, and write it to a file called 'log-ins'. The second command, separated by a semi-colon (;) will then print that file using lp.

last > $HOME/log-ins; lp $HOME/log-ins

press 'Enter' and then 'Ctl + d' and you will see the following:

job 15 at 2003-02-16 12:45



. You can cancel these jobs as well. If you type:

atrm 15

you will remove job 15 from the 'at' queue. To see what is in the 'at' queue, type:

atq

You can control which users are allowed to use 'at'. By default

/etc/at.deny

controls who cannot use 'at'. That is to say, the users listed in at.deny cannot use it. You can also create an

/etc/at.allow

file. Creating at.allow makes the at daemon ignore the

/etc/at.deny

Therefore, anyone who is not in at.allow cannot use 'at'.
