Divide the partition byte offset by the block size to determine the block offset, in this case 8951424 / 4096 = 2185

Run the following command to find out what inode occupies that block:

user@host:~$ sudo debugfs -R "icheck 2185" /dev/sda1
debugfs 1.41.11 (14-Mar-2010)
Block   Inode number
2185    123456 

then the following command to find out what the filename is for that inode:

user@host:~$ sudo debugfs -R "ncheck 123456" /dev/sda1
debugfs 1.41.11 (14-Mar-2010)
Inode   Pathname
123456  /tmp/some-filename.txt


mount | grep /dev/nvme0n1p5

lubuntu@lubuntu:~$ sudo mount -o remount,noatime /media/lubuntu/ARQ

STAT(1)

NAME
       stat - display file or file system status

SYNOPSIS
       stat [OPTION] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Display file or file system status.

       -L, --dereference
              follow links

       -f, --file-system
              display file system status instead of file status

       -c  --format=FORMAT
              use the specified FORMAT instead of the default; output a newline after each use of FORMAT

       --printf=FORMAT
              like  --format, but interpret backslash escapes, and do not output a mandatory trailing newline.  If you want a newline, include \n in FOR‐
              MAT.

       -t, --terse
              print the information in terse form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The valid format sequences for files (without --file-system):

       %a     Access rights in octal

       %A     Access rights in human readable form

       %b     Number of blocks allocated (see %B)

       %B     The size in bytes of each block reported by %b

       %C     SELinux security context string

       %d     Device number in decimal

       %D     Device number in hex

       %f     Raw mode in hex

       %F     File type

       %g     Group ID of owner

       %G     Group name of owner

       %h     Number of hard links

       %i     Inode number

       %n     File name

       %N     Quoted file name with dereference if symbolic link

       %o     I/O block size

       %s     Total size, in bytes

       %t     Major device type in hex

       %T     Minor device type in hex

       %u     User ID of owner

       %U     User name of owner

       %x     Time of last access

       %X     Time of last access as seconds since Epoch

       %y     Time of last modification

       %Y     Time of last modification as seconds since Epoch

       %z     Time of last change

       %Z     Time of last change as seconds since Epoch

       Valid format sequences for file systems:

       %a     Free blocks available to non-superuser

       %b     Total data blocks in file system

       %c     Total file nodes in file system

       %d     Free file nodes in file system

       %f     Free blocks in file system

       %C     SELinux security context string

       %i     File System ID in hex

       %l     Maximum length of filenames

       %n     File name

       %s     Block size (for faster transfers)

       %S     Fundamental block size (for block counts)

       %t     Type in hex

       %T     Type in human readable form

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of stat, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your  shell’s  documenta‐
       tion for details about the options it supports.
