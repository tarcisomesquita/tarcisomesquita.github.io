USERADD(8)

useradd create a new user or update default new user information

SYNOPSIS
useradd [options] LOGIN
useradd -D [options]

LOGIN
only use usernames that begin with a lower case letter or an underscore, and are only followed by lower case letters, digits, underscores, dashes, and optionally terminated by a dollar sign. In regular expression terms: [a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*[$]?
Usernames may only be up to 32 characters long.

OPTIONS
The options which apply to the useradd command are:

-c, --comment COMMENT
    Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is currently used as the field for the user´s full name.

-D, --defaults
    See below, the subsection "Changing the default values".

-d, --home HOME_DIR
    The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user´s login directory.
    Exemplo: /usr/sbin/adduser --home /home/teste2 teste2

-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
    The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

-f, --inactive INACTIVE
    The number of days after a password expires until the account is permanently disabled. A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the
    password has expired, and a value of -1 disables the feature. The default value is -1.

-g, --gid GROUP
    The group name or number of the user´s initial login group. The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.
    The default group number is 1 or whatever is specified in /etc/default/useradd.

-G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
    A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening
    whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The default is for the user to belong only
    to the initial group.

-k, --skel SKEL_DIR
    The skeleton directory, which contains files and directories to be copied in the user´s home directory.
    Default is /etc/skel.

-K, --key KEY=VALUE
    Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults (UID_MIN, UID_MAX, UMASK, PASS_MAX_DAYS and others).

    Example: -K PASS_MAX_DAYS=-1 can be used when creating system account to turn off password ageing, even though system account has no password
    at all. Multiple -K options can be specified, e.g.: -K UID_MIN=100
     -K UID_MAX=499

    Note: -K UID_MIN=10,UID_MAX=499 doesn´t work yet.

    For the compatibility with previous Debian´s useradd, the -O option is also supported.

-N, --no-user-group
    Do not create a group with the same name as the user, but add the user to the group specified by the -g option or by the GROUP variable in
    /etc/default/useradd.

    The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in login.defs.

-p, --password PASSWORD
    The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3). The default is to disable the account.

-r, --system
    Create a system account.

    System users will be created with no aging information in /etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are choosen in the
    SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in login.defs, instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the creation of groups).

-s, --shell SHELL
    The name of the user´s login shell.

-u, --uid UID
    The numerical value of the user´s ID. This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. The default is
    to use the smallest ID value greater than 999 and greater than every other user. Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system
    accounts.

-U, --user-group
    Create a group with the same name as the user, and add the user to this group.

    The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in login.defs.

   Changing the default values
When invoked with only the -D option, useradd will display the current default values.
Exemplo:
$ useradd -D
GROUP=100
HOME=/home
INACTIVE=-1
EXPIRE=
SHELL=/bin/sh
SKEL=/etc/skel
CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=no

/etc/group, which lists the names of the groups on your system
SKEL=/etc/skel means that the files located in /etc/skel will be copied to the users directory when you create the account.

When invoked with -D plus other options, useradd will update the default values specified.

-b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
    The path prefix for home directory.

-e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
    The date on which the user account is disabled.

-f, --inactive INACTIVE
    The number of days after a password has expired before the account will be disabled.

-g, --gid GROUP
    The group name or ID. The named group must exist, and a numerical group ID must have an existing entry.

-s, --shell SHELL
    The name of shell.

CONFIGURATION
The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:

GID_MAX (number), GID_MIN (number)
    Range of group IDs used for the creation of regular groups by useradd, useradd, or newusers.

MAIL_DIR (string)
    The mail spool directory. This is needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user account is modified or deleted. If not
    specified, a compile-time default is used.

MAIL_FILE (string)
    Defines the location of the users mail spool files relatively to their home directory.

The MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE variables are used by useradd, usermod, and userdel to create, move, or delete the user´s mail spool.

MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number)
    Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same
    password, and same GID).

    The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group.

    This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS groups are
    not larger than 1024 characters.

    If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

    Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the Shadow toolsuite. You should not use this variable unless you really need
    it.

PASS_MAX_DAYS (number)
    The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1
    will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

PASS_MIN_DAYS (number)
    The minimum number of days allowed between password changes. Any password changes attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If not
    specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

PASS_WARN_AGE (number)
    The number of days warning given before a password expires. A zero means warning is given only upon the day of expiration, a negative value
    means no warning is given. If not specified, no warning will be provided.

SYS_GID_MAX (number), SYS_GID_MIN (number)
    Range of group IDs used for the creation of system groups by useradd, groupadd, or newusers.

SYS_UID_MAX (number), SYS_UID_MIN (number)
    Range of user IDs used for the creation of system users by useradd or newusers.

UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number)
    Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by useradd or newusers.

UMASK (number)
    The permission mask is initialized to this value. If not specified, the permission mask will be initialized to 022.

USERGROUPS_ENAB (boolean)

FILES
/etc/passwd
    User account information.

/etc/shadow
    Secure user account information.

/etc/group
    Group account information.

/etc/default/useradd
    Default values for account creation.
