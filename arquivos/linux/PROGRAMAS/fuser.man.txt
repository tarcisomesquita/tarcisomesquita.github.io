FUSER(1)

SYNOPSIS
 fuser [-a|-s|-c] [-4|-6] [-n space ] [-k [-i] [-signal ] ] [-muvf] name ...
 fuser -l
 fuser -V

displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files, file systems, TCP and UDP sockets.
# fuser ./ (mostra os processos que estão usando o diretório atual)

In the default display mode, each file name is followed by a letter denoting the type of access:
c   current directory.
e   executable being run.
f   open file. f is omitted in default display mode.
F   open file for writing. F is omitted in default display mode.
r   root directory.
m   mmap’ed file or shared library.

By default fuser will look in both IPv6 and IPv4 sockets.
Can be specified the local port, the remote address and the remote port. [lcl_port][,[rmt_host][,[rmt_port]]]
ex.: fuser 35395,127.0.0.1,8080/tcp
Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses and port numbers.

fuser outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to stderr.

OPTIONS
-  Reset all options and set the signal back to SIGKILL.

-4   Search only for IPv4 sockets.

-6   Search only for IPv6 sockets.

-a   Show all files specified on the command line. By default, only files that are accessed by at least one process are shown.

-k   Kill processes accessing the file.
     Unless changed with -signal, SIGKILL is sent.
     # fuser -k -m -i /home    kills all processes accessing the file system /home in any way.
     # fuser -k /media/cdrom   mata o processo que impedia o cdrom de ser desmontado

-i   Ask the user for confirmation before killing a process. This option is silently ignored if -k is not present too.

-l   List all known signal names.
     # fuser -l
     # fuser -k TERM -i ./

-m   name specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block device that is mounted. All processes accessing files on that file system are listed.
     If a directory file is specified, it is automatically changed to name/. to use any file system that might be mounted on that directory.
     # fuser -m /dev/sdb1
     # fuser -m /dev/sgX will show all processes, even if you don’t have that device configured.

-n space
     Select a different name space.
     The name spaces file (file names, the default), udp (local UDP ports), and tcp (local TCP ports) are supported.
     For ports, either the port number or the symbolic name can be specified.
     # fuser -n tcp 631/tcp

-s   Silent operation. -u and -v are ignored in this mode. -a must not be used with -s.
     # if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :; else something; fi invokes something if no other process is using /dev/ttyS1.

  -signal
     Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing processes.
     Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. -HUP) or by number (e.g.-1).
     This option is silently ignored if the -k option is not used.
     # fuser -k -TERM -i 8080/tcp

-u   Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

-v   Verbose mode. Show fields USER, PID, ACCESS and COMMAND are similar to ps.

-V   Display version information.
