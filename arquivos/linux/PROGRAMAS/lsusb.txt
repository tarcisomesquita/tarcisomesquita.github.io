lsusb [ options ]

a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them.

you need to have a kernel which supports the /proc/bus/usb interface

OPTIONS
-v, --verbose
Class descriptors will be shown, when available, for USB device classes including hub, audio, HID, communications, and chipcard.

-s [[bus]:][devnum]
Show only devices in specified bus and/or devnum.  Both ID's are given in decimal and may be omitted.

-d [vendor]:[product]
Show only devices with the specified vendor and product ID.  Both ID's are given in hexadecimal.

-D device
Do not scan the /proc/bus/usb directory, instead display only information about the device whose device file is given.
The device file should be something like /proc/bus/usb/001/001.

-t     Tells lsusb to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree.

-V, --version
Print  version information on standard output, then exit successfully.


DIAGNOSTICS
cannot open /proc/bus/usb/nnn/nnn, Permission denied (13)
To get detailed information, lsusb must open the files in /proc/bus/usb in read-write mode.  You must be root in order to do this.


RETURN VALUE
If the specified device is not found, a non-zero exit code is returned.


FILES
/var/lib/misc/usb.ids
A list of all known USB ID's (vendors, products, classes, subclasses and protocols).

/proc/bus/usb
An interface to USB devices provided by the post-2.3.15 Linux kernels. Contains per-bus subdirectories with per-device files and a devices file displaying some of the descriptors for each USB device.  This interface is also support by some 2.2 Linux kernels.
