DESCRIPTION
       argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.
       The  default action is to search in all of the available sections, following a pre-defined order and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.


       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro  packages  and  conven-
           tions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]


       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the  available  intro  manual  pages
           contained  within  the manual.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword
           printf as regular expression.  Print out any  matches.   Equivalent
           to apropos -r printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short
           descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis -r smail.

read manpath(5)

Native language manual pages are accessible if set either $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG


       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the man-
              ual page, if available. See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent  to  apropos.   Search the short manual page descrip-
              tions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1)  for
              details.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate  'local'  mode.   Format and display local manual files
              instead of searching through  the  system's  manual  collection.

       -w, --where, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual pages, but do print the loca-
              tion(s) of the source nroff files that would be formatted.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output
              its source converted to the specified encoding.
              You can also use manconv(1).


   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              use this option to supply a locale string directly to man. Ex.: man -L pt_BR passwd

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate manpath to use.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages. This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable
              manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man  to  display
              all  the manual pages with names that match the search criteria.


   Controlling formatted output

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.
              For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such
              as ascii, latin1, or utf8 as well as a true  character  encoding
              such as UTF-8.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML  output,  and  will
              display  that output in a web browser.


ENVIRONMENT

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH  is  set, its value is used as the line length for
              which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set,  man-
              ual  pages  will  be formatted with a line length appropriate to
              the current terminal (using an ioctl(2) if available, the  value
              of  $COLUMNS,  or  falling  back  to 80 characters if neither is
              available).

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man
              A global manual page hierarchy.
