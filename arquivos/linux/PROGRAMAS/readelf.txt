readelf [OPTIONS] elffile

This program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library, so if there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.

OPTIONS
       --file-header
           Displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of the file.

       --program-headers
           Displays the information contained in the file's segment headers, if it has any.

       -S
       --sections
       --section-headers
           Displays the information contained in the file's section headers, if it has any.

       -g
       --section-groups
           Displays the information contained in the file's section groups, if it has any.

       -t
       --section-details
           Displays the detailed section information. Implies --section-headers.

       -s
       --symbols
       --syms
           Displays the entries in symbol table section of the file, if it has one.

       --dyn-syms
           Displays the entries in dynamic symbol table section of the file, if it has one.

       -r
       --relocs
           Displays the contents of the file's relocation section, if it has one.

       -u
       --unwind
           Displays the contents of the file's unwind section, if it has one.  Only the unwind sections for IA64 ELF files, as well as ARM unwind tables (".ARM.exidx" / ".ARM.extab") are currently supported.

       --dynamic
           Displays the contents of the file's dynamic section, if it has one.

       --version-info
           Displays the contents of the version sections in the file, it they exist.

       --arch-specific
           Displays architecture-specific information in the file, if there is any.

       -D
       --use-dynamic
           When displaying symbols, this option makes readelf use the symbol hash tables in the file's dynamic section, rather than the symbol table sections.

       -x <number or name>
       --hex-dump=<number or name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal bytes.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the object file.

       -R <number or name>
       --relocated-dump=<number or name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal bytes.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the object file.  The contents of the section will be relocated before they are displayed.

       -p <number or name>
       --string-dump=<number or name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as printable strings.  A number identifies a particular section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the object file.

       -c
       --archive-index
           Displays the file symbol index information contained in the header part of binary archives.  Performs the same function as the t command to ar, but without using the BFD library.

       -w[lLiaprmfFsoRt]
       --debug-dump[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges,=pubtypes,=trace_info,=trace_abbrev,=trace_aranges,=gdb_index]
           Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are present.  If one of the optional letters or words follows the switch then only data found in those specific sections will be dumped.

           Note that there is no single letter option to display the content of trace sections or .gdb_index.

           Note: the =decodedline option will display the interpreted contents of a .debug_line section whereas the =rawline option dumps the contents in a raw format.

           Note: the =frames-interp option will display the interpreted contents of a .debug_frame section whereas the =frames option dumps the contents in a raw format.

           Note: the output from the =info option can also be affected by the options --dwarf-depth and --dwarf-start.

       --dwarf-depth=n
           Limit the dump of the ".debug_info" section to n children.  This is only useful with --debug-dump=info.  The default is to print all DIEs; the special value 0 for n will also have this effect.

           With a non-zero value for n, DIEs at or deeper than n levels will not be printed.  The range for n is zero-based.

       --dwarf-start=n
           Print only DIEs beginning with the DIE numbered n.  This is only useful with --debug-dump=info.

           If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header information and all DIEs before the DIE numbered n.  Only siblings and children of the specified DIE will be printed.

           This can be used in conjunction with --dwarf-depth.

       --histogram
           Display a histogram of bucket list lengths when displaying the contents of the symbol tables.

       --version
           Display the version number of readelf.

       -W
       --wide
           Don't break output lines to fit into 80 columns. By default readelf breaks section header and segment listing lines for 64-bit ELF files, so that they fit into 80 columns. This option causes readelf to print each section header resp. each segment one a single line, which is far more readable on terminals wider than 80 columns.

       --help
           Display the command line options understood by readelf.
