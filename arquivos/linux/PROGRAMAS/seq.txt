The seq command gives you the ability to skip digits, and also with the -w switch can add leading zeros if needed.
To use the seq command to make a list we need to enclose the command in $( ).

echo $( seq 1 3 )
1 2 3

echo `seq 1 3` # This is the old way and can cause problems, but it is still commonly used.
1 2 3
