pstree -n -p
 
SYNOPSIS
pstree [-a] [-c] [-h|-Hpid] [-l] [-n] [-p] [-u] [-Z] [-A|-G|-U] [pid|user]
pstree -V

DESCRIPTION
pstree  shows  running  processes  as a tree. The tree is rooted at either pid or init if pid is omitted. If a user name is specified, all process
trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.

pstree visually merges identical branches by putting them in square brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count, e.g.
   init-+-getty
        |-getty
        |-getty
        --getty
becomes
   init---4*[getty]

Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and are shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.
   icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]

OPTIONS
-a     Show  command line arguments.
-A     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.
-h     Highlight the current process and its ancestors.
-H pid Highlight the specified process.
-l     Display  long  lines. By default, lines are truncated to the display width or 132 if output is sent to a non-tty or if the display width is unknown.
-n     Sort processes with the same ancestor by PID instead of by name. (Numeric sort.)
-p     Show PIDs. PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses after each process name. -p implicitly disables compaction.
-u     Show uid transitions. Whenever the uid of a process differs from the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown in parentheses after the  process name.
-U     Use  UTF-8 line drawing characters. UTF-8 mode is entered on the console with echo -e '\033%8' and left with echo -e '\033%@'
-V     Display version information.
