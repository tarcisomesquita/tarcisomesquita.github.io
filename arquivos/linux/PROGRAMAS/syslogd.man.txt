SYSKLOGD(8)

start the syslogd with 'syslogd -r'
configure your other machines to send the data adding an entry like this one in /etc/syslog.conf:
facility.level   @your_loghost
facility should be one of authpriv, cron, daemon, kern, lpr, mail, news, syslog, user, uucp and local1 up to local7.
level should be alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info debug.
If you want to log everything remote, just write:
*.*   @your_loghost


NAME
       sysklogd - Linux system logging utilities.

SYNOPSIS
       syslogd [-a socket] [-d] [-f config file] [-h] [-l hostlist] [-m interval] [-n] [-p socket] [-r] [-s domainlist] [-u user] [-v]

OPTIONS
       -m interval
              The syslogd logs a mark timestamp regularly.  The default interval between two -- MARK -- lines is 20 minutes.
              Setting the interval to zero turns it off entirely.

       -p socket
              You can specify an alternative unix domain socket instead of /dev/log.

       -r     This option will enable the facility to receive message from the network.

       -u user
              The syslogd daemon runs with full root privileges by default. If you specify this option, the daemon will drop its privileges to the  given
              user  (and  the  primary  group of this user) before starting up logging. This greatly reduces the potential impact of exploitable security
              holes in syslogd.
              syslogd will still open all log files as root at startup.  However, after receiving a SIGHUP signal (which causes the  daemon  to  restart)
              the  log  files will be reopened as the non-privileged user which fails if the log files are only writeable by root.

CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX DIFFERENCES
        For  example  the  following line caused ALL output from daemons using the daemon facilities (debug is the lowest priority, so every higher
        will also match) to go into /usr/adm/daemons:
        # Sample syslog.conf
        daemon.debug             /usr/adm/daemons

       The  *  specifies  that all messages for the specified facility are to be directed to the destination.

       The = wildcard is used to restrict logging to the specified priority class.  This allows, for example, routing only debug messages to a particular
       logging source.
       *.=debug            /usr/adm/debug

       The ! is used to exclude logging of the specified priorities.  This affects all (!) possibilities of specifying priorities.
       To log all messages of the facility mail except those with the priority info to the /usr/adm/mail file.
       mail.*;mail.!=info       /usr/adm/mail
       To log all messages from news.info (including) to news.crit (excluding) would be logged to the /usr/adm/news file.
       news.info;news.!crit     /usr/adm/news

       The - may only be used to prefix a filename if you want to omit sync'ing the file after every write to it.

SUPPORT FOR REMOTE LOGGING
       The  strategy  is  to  have syslogd listen on a unix domain socket for locally generated log messages.  This behavior will allow syslogd to inter-
       operate with the syslog found in the standard C library.

       To syslogd listens network or send data, the services(5) files (typically found in /etc) must have the following entry:
       syslog          514/udp

       To cause messages to be forwarded to another host replace the normal file line in the syslog.conf file with the name of the host to which the mes-
       sages is to be sent prepended with an @.
              For example, to forward ALL messages to a remote host use the following syslog.conf entry:
              *.*            @hostname

              To forward all kernel messages to a remote host the configuration file would be as follows:
              kern.*         @hostname

FILES
       /etc/syslog.conf
          Configuration file for syslogd.  See syslog.conf(5) for exact information.
          Lines that begin with the hash mark ("#") and empty lines are ignored. If an error occurs during parsing the whole line is ignored.
       /dev/log
              The Unix domain socket to from where local syslog messages are read.
       /var/run/syslogd.pid
              The file containing the process id of syslogd.
