runlevel(8)

SYNOPSIS
runlevel [UTMP]

DESCRIPTION
runlevel reads the system utmp file (typically /var/run/utmp) to locate the most recent runlevel record, then outputs the previous and current runlevel to standard output, separated by a single space.
If there is no previous runlevel in the record, the letter N will be printed instead.
If no utmp file exists, or if no runlevel record can be found, runlevel prints the word unknown and exits with an error.

EXIT STATUS
runlevel will exit with status 0 if a utmp record was found or written to the file, otherwise it will exit with status 1.
