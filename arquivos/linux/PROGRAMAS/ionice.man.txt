ionice(1)

ionice [-c] [-n] [-p] [COMMAND [ARG...]]

sets or gets the io scheduling class and priority for a program.
If no arguments or just -p is given, ionice will query the current io scheduling class and priority for that process.

a process can be in one of three scheduling classes:
- Idle 
   A program running with idle io priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for disk io for a defined grace period.

- Best effort
   This is the effective scheduling class for any process that has not asked for a specific io priority. This class takes a priority argument
from 0-7, with lower number being higher priority. Programs running at the same best effort priority are served in a round-robin fashion.

The processes that has not asked for io priority formally use "none" as a scheduling class, but the io scheduler will treat such processes
as if they were in the best effort class. The priority within the best effort class will be dynamically derived from the cpu nice level of
the process: io_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.

- Real time
   The RT scheduling class is given first access to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the system. Thus the RT class needs to be
used with some care, as it can starve other processes. As with the best effort class, 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time
slice a given process will receive on each scheduling window. This scheduling class is not permitted for an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user.

OPTIONS
-c   The scheduling class. 1 for real time, 2 for best-effort, 3 for idle.
-n   The scheduling class data. This defines the class data, if the class accepts an argument. For real time and best-effort, 0-7 is valid data.
-p   Pass in a process pid to change an already running process. If this argument is not given, ionice will run the listed program with the
given parameters.

EXAMPLES
# ionice -c3 -p89
Sets process with PID 89 as an idle io process.

# ionice -c2 -n0 bash
Runs ’bash’ as a best-effort program with highest priority.

# ionice -p89
Returns the class and priority of the process with PID 89.
