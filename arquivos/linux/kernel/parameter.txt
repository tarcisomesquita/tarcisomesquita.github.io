arch/i386/boot/video.S
CONFIG_VIDEO_SVGA - enables autodetection of SVGA cards.

	init=		[KNL]
			Format: <full_path>
			Run specified binary instead of /sbin/init as init process.

	initrd=		[BOOT] Specify the location of the initial ramdisk

	rdinit=		[KNL]
			Format: <full_path>
			Run specified binary instead of /init from the ramdisk, used for early userspace startup. See initrd.

	root=		[KNL] Root filesystem
			See name_to_dev_t comment in init/do_mounts.c.

	rootflags=	[KNL] Set root filesystem mount option string

	rootfstype=	[KNL] Set root filesystem type

	rw		[KNL] Mount root device read-write on boot

	debug		[KNL] Enable kernel debugging (events log level).

	earlyprintk=
			earlyprintk=vga
			earlyprintk=efi

			Append ",keep" to not disable it when the real console takes over.


acpi_backlight=video
use video.ko

acpi=off


	apic=
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }
			Change the amount of debugging information output
			when initialising the APIC and IO-APIC components.

	debug		[KNL] Enable kernel debugging (events log level).

	disable=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.


	disable_ipv6=	[IPV6]
			See Documentation/networking/ipv6.txt.

	max_addr=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT,ia64] All physical memory greater
			than or equal to this physical address is ignored.

	mem=nn[KMG]	[KNL,BOOT] Force usage of a specific amount of memory
			Amount of memory to be used when the kernel is not able
			to see the whole system memory or for test.
			[X86-32] Use together with memmap= to avoid physical
			address space collisions. Without memmap= PCI devices
			could be placed at addresses belonging to unused RAM.
            The value is in decimal or hexadecimal (prefix 0x)


	memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
			[KNL] Force usage of a specific region of memory
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]#ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as ACPI data.
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
			Example: Exclude memory from 0x18690000-0x1869ffff
			         memmap=64K$0x18690000
			         or
			         memmap=0x10000$0x18690000

	memtest=	[KNL,X86] Enable memtest
			Format: <integer>
			default : 0 <disable>
			Specifies the number of memtest passes to be
			performed. Each pass selects another test
			pattern from a given set of patterns. Memtest
			fills the memory with this pattern, validates
			memory contents and reserves bad memory
			regions that are detected.


	nousb		[USB] Disable the USB subsystem


	pci=option[,option...]	[PCI] various PCI subsystem options:
		earlydump	[X86] dump PCI config space before the kernel
			        changes anything
		off		[X86] don't probe for the PCI bus
		bios		[X86-32] force use of PCI BIOS, don't access
				the hardware directly. Use this if your machine
				has a non-standard PCI host bridge.
		nobios		[X86-32] disallow use of PCI BIOS, only direct
				hardware access methods are allowed. Use this
				if you experience crashes upon bootup and you
				suspect they are caused by the BIOS.

		noacpi		[X86] Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
				or for PCI scanning.

	pcie_ports=	[PCIE] PCIe ports handling:
		auto	Ask the BIOS whether or not to use native PCIe services
			associated with PCIe ports (PME, hot-plug, AER).  Use
			them only if that is allowed by the BIOS.
		native	Use native PCIe services associated with PCIe ports
			unconditionally.
		compat	Treat PCIe ports as PCI-to-PCI bridges, disable the PCIe
			ports driver.


	ramdisk_size=	[RAM] Sizes of RAM disks in kilobytes
			See Documentation/blockdev/ramdisk.txt.

	resume=		[SWSUSP]
			Specify the partition device for software suspend


	video=		[FB] Frame buffer configuration
			See Documentation/fb/modedb.txt.


              netdev=0,0,eth1
              Note that the values of zero for the IRQ and I/O base in the above example tell the driver(s) to autoprobe.

	netdev=		[NET] Network devices parameters
			Format: <irq>,<io>,<mem_start>,<mem_end>,<name>
			Note that mem_start is often overloaded to mean something different and driver-specific.
			This usage is only documented in each driver source file if at all.
