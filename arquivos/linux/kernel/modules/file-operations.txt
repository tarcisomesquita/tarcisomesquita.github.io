File operations
functions defined by the driver that perform various operations on the device.

gcc extension that makes assigning to this structure more convenient.
struct file_operations fops = {
	read: device_read,
	write: device_write,
	open: device_open,
	release: device_release
};

C99 way of assigning to elements of a structure, and this is definitely preferred over using the GNU extension.
struct file_operations fops = {
	.read = device_read,
	.write = device_write,
	.open = device_open,
	.release = device_release
};


Each device is represented in the kernel by a file structure, which is defined in linux-2.6.28.10/include/linux/fs.h.
An instance of struct file is commonly named filp. You'll also see it refered to as struct file file.
This is because drivers don't fill file directly; they only use structures contained in file.
