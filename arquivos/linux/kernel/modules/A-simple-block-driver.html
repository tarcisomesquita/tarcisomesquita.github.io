</td></tr></tbody></table>

Given the large number of changes to the 2.6 block layer, it is hard to
know where to start describing them.  We'll begin by examining the simplest
possible block driver.  The sbd ("simple block device") driver simulates a
block device with a region of kernel memory; it is, essentially, a naive
ramdisk driver implemented in less than 200 lines of code.  It will allow
the demonstration of some changes in how 
block drivers work with the rest of the system without the need for all the
complexity required when one is dealing with real hardware.  Code fragments
will be shown below; the full driver source can be found <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/58720/">on this page</a>. 
<p>
If you have not read <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/24990/">the block layer
overview</a>, you might want to head over there for a moment; this article
will still be here when you get back.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Initialization</h3>

In our simple driver, the module initialization function is called
<tt>sbd_init()</tt>.  Its job, of course, is to get set up for block
operations and to make its disk available to the system.  The first step is
to set up our internal data structure; within the driver a disk (<i>the</i>
disk, in this case) is represented by:
<p>
</p><pre>	static struct sbd_device {
	    unsigned long size;
	    spinlock_t lock;
	    u8 *data;
	    struct gendisk *gd;
	} Device;
</pre>
<p>
Here <tt>size</tt> is the size of the device (in bytes), <tt>data</tt> is
the array where the "disk" stores its data, <tt>lock</tt> is a spinlock for
mutual exclusion, and <tt>gd</tt> is the kernel
representation of our device.  
</p><p>
The device initialization is pretty straightforward; it is just a matter of
allocating the memory to actually store the data and initializing the
spinlock:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    Device.size = nsectors*hardsect_size;
    spin_lock_init(&amp;Device.lock);
    Device.data = vmalloc(Device.size);
    if (Device.data == NULL)
	return -ENOMEM;
</pre>
<p>
(<tt>nsectors</tt> and <tt>hardsect_size</tt> are load-time parameters that
control how big the device should be).  
</p><p>
About now is where block drivers traditionally register themselves with the
kernel, and <tt>sbd</tt> does that too:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    major_num = register_blkdev(major_num, "sbd");
    if (major_num &lt;= 0) {
	printk(KERN_WARNING "sbd: unable to get major number\n");
	goto out;
    }
</pre>
<p>
Note that, in 2.6, no device operations structure is passed to
<tt>register_blkdev()</tt>.  As it turns out, 
a block driver can happily get by without calling
<tt>register_blkdev()</tt> at all.  That function does little work, at this
point, and will likely be removed sooner or later.  About
the only remaining tasks performed by <tt>register_blkdev()</tt> are the
assignment of a dynamic major number (if requested), and causing the block
driver to show up in <tt>/proc/devices</tt>.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Generic disks</h3>

If <tt>register_blkdev()</tt> no longer does anything, where does the real
work get done?  The answer lies in the much improved 2.6 "generic disk" (or
"gendisk") code.  The gendisk interface is covered in <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/25711/">a separate article</a>, so we'll look only quickly
at how <tt>sbd</tt> does its gendisk setup. 
<p>
The first step is to get a <tt>gendisk</tt> structure to represent the
<tt>sbd</tt> device:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    Device.gd = alloc_disk(16);
    if (! Device.gd)
	goto out_unregister;
</pre>
<p>
Note that a memory allocation is involved, so the return value should be
checked.  The parameter to <tt>alloc_disk()</tt> indicates the number of
minor numbers that should be dedicated to this device.  We have requested
16 minor numbers, meaning that the device will support 15 partitions.
</p><p>
The gendisk must be initialized; the <tt>sbd</tt> driver starts that task
as follows:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    Device.gd-&gt;major = major_num;
    Device.gd-&gt;first_minor = 0;
    Device.gd-&gt;fops = &amp;sbd_ops;
    Device.gd-&gt;private_data = &amp;Device;
    strcpy (Device.gd-&gt;disk_name, "sbd0");
    set_capacity(Device.gd, nsectors*(hardsect_size/KERNEL_SECTOR_SIZE));
</pre>
<p>
Most of the above should be relatively self-explanatory.  The <tt>fops</tt>
field is a pointer to the <tt>block_device_operations</tt> structure for
this device; we'll get to that shortly.  The <tt>private_data</tt> field
can be used by the driver, so we stick a pointer to our <tt>sbd_device</tt>
structure there.  The <tt>set_capacity()</tt> call tells the kernel how
large the device is.  Note that the kernel can handle block devices which
have sectors greater than 512 bytes, but it always deals with 512-byte
sectors internally.  So we need to normalize the sector count before
passing it to the kernel.
</p><p>
Another thing that (usually) goes into the gendisk is the request queue to
use.  The <tt>BLK_DEFAULT_QUEUE</tt> macro from 2.4 is no more; a block
driver must explicitly create and set up the request queue(s) it will use.
Furthermore, request queues must be allocated dynamicly, at run time.  The
<tt>sbd</tt> driver sets up its request queue as follows:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    static struct request_queue *Queue;
    /* ... */
    Queue = blk_init_queue(sbd_request, &amp;Device.lock);
    if (Queue == NULL)
	    goto out;
    blk_queue_hardsect_size(Queue, hardsect_size);
    Device.gd-&gt;queue = Queue;
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>sbd_request</tt> is the request function, which we will get to
soon.  
Note that a spinlock must be passed into <tt>blk_init_queue()</tt>.  The
global <tt>io_request_lock</tt> is gone forevermore, and each block driver
must manage its own locking.  Typically, the lock used by the driver to
serialize access to internal resources is the best choice for controlling
access to the request queue as well.  For
that reason, the block layer expects the driver to provide a lock of its
own for the queue.  If a nonstandard hard sector size (i.e. not 512 bytes)
is in use, the sector size should be stored into the request queue with
<tt>blk_queue_hardsect_size()</tt>.  Finally, a pointer to the queue must
be stored in the <tt>gendisk</tt> structure.
</p><p>
At this point, the gendisk setup is complete.  All that remains is to add
the disk to the system:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    add_disk(Device.gd);
</pre>
<p>
Note that <tt>add_disk()</tt> may well generate I/O to the device before it
returns - the
driver must be in a state where it can handle requests before adding
disks.  The driver also should not fail initialization after it has
successfully added a disk.
</p><p>
</p><h3>What you don't have to do</h3>

That is the end of the initialization process for the <tt>sbd</tt> driver.
What you don't have to do is as notable as what does need to be done.
For example, there are no assignments to global arrays; the whole set of
global variables that used to describe block devices is gone.  There is
also nothing here for dealing with partition setup.  Partition handling is
now done in the generic block layer, and there is almost nothing that
individual drivers must do at this point.  "Almost" because the driver must
handle one <tt>ioctl()</tt> call, as described below.

<p>
</p><h3>Open and release</h3>

The <tt>open</tt> and <tt>release</tt> methods (which are kept in the
<tt>block_device_operations</tt> structure) actually have not changed since
2.4.  The <tt>sbd</tt> driver has nothing to do at open or release time, so
it doesn't even bother to define these methods.  Drivers for real hardware
may need to lock and unlock doors, check for media, etc. in these methods.

<p>
</p><h3>The request method</h3>

The core of a block driver, of course, is its <tt>request</tt> method.  The
<tt>sbd</tt> driver has the simplest possible <tt>request</tt> function; it
does not concern itself with things like request clustering, barriers,
etc.  It does not understand the new <tt>bio</tt> structure used to
represent requests at all.  But it works.  Real drivers will almost
certainly require a more serious <tt>request</tt> method; see the other <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/">Driver Porting Series</a> articles for the
gory details on how to do that.
<p>
Here is the whole thing:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    static void sbd_request(request_queue_t *q)
    {
        struct request *req;
    
        while ((req = elv_next_request(q)) != NULL) {
            if (! blk_fs_request(req)) {
                end_request(req, 0);
                continue;
            }
            sbd_transfer(&amp;Device, req-&gt;sector, req-&gt;current_nr_sectors,
                            req-&gt;buffer, rq_data_dir(req));
            end_request(req, 1);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>

The first thing to notice is that all of the old
<tt>&lt;linux/blk.h&gt;</tt> cruft has been removed.  Macros like
<tt>INIT_REQUEST</tt> (with its hidden <tt>return</tt> statement),
<tt>CURRENT</tt>, and <tt>QUEUE_EMPTY</tt> are gone.  It is now necessary
to deal with the request queue functions directly, but, as can be seen,
that is not particularly hard.
</p><p>
Note that the <tt>Device.lock</tt> will be held on entry to the
<tt>request</tt> function, much like <tt>io_request_lock</tt> is in 2.4. 
</p><p>
The function for getting the first request in the queue is now
<tt>elv_next_request()</tt>.  A <tt>NULL</tt> return means that there are
no more requests on the queue that are ready to process.  
A simple request loop like this one can simply run until the request queue
is empty; drivers for real hardware will also have to take into account how
many operations the device can handle, of course.
Note that this function does <i>not</i>
actually remove the request from the queue; it just returns a properly
adjusted view of the top request.  
</p><p>
Note also that, in 2.6, there can be
multiple types of requests.  Thus the test:
</p><p>
</p><pre>	if (! blk_fs_request(req)) {
	    end_request(req, 0);
	    continue;
	}
</pre>
<p>
A nonzero return value from the <tt>blk_fs_request()</tt> macro says  "this
is a normal filesystem request." 
Other types of requests (i.e. packet-mode or device-specific diagnostic
operations)  are not something that <tt>sbd</tt> supports, so it
simply fails any such requests.  
</p><p>
The function <tt>sbd_transfer()</tt> is really just a <tt>memcpy()</tt>
with some checking; see the full source if you are interested.  The key is
in the parameters: the various fields of the <tt>request</tt> structure
(<tt>sector</tt>, <tt>current_nr_sectors</tt>, and <tt>buffer</tt>) look
just like they did in 2.4.  They also have the same meaning: they are a
window looking at the first part of a (possibly larger) request.  If you
deal with block requests at this level, you need know nothing of the
<tt>bio</tt> structures underlying the request.  This approach only works
for the simplest of drivers, however.
</p><p>
Note that the direction of the request is now found in the <tt>flags</tt>
field, and can be tested with <tt>rq_data_dir()</tt>.  A nonzero value
(<tt>WRITE</tt>) indicates that this is a write request.  Note also the
absence of any code adding partition offsets; all of that is handled in the
higher layers.
</p><p>
Finally, <tt>end_request()</tt> is called to finish processing of this
request.  This function has picked up a new parameter in 2.6, being the
pointer to the <tt>request</tt> structure.



</p><p>
</p><h3>Other block operations</h3>

The two other <tt>block_device_operations</tt> methods from 2.4 -
<tt>check_media_change()</tt> and <tt>revalidate()</tt> - have seen prototype
changes in 2.5.  They are now called <tt>media_changed()</tt> and
<tt>revalidate_disk()</tt>, and both take a <tt>gendisk</tt> structure as
their only argument.  The basic task performed by these methods remains
unchanged, however.  
<p>
In 2.4, a block driver's <tt>ioctl()</tt> method would handle any commands
it understood, and pass the rest on to <tt>blk_ioctl()</tt> for generic
processing.  In 2.6, the generic code gets the first crack at any
<tt>ioctl()</tt> calls, and only invokes the driver for those it can't
implement itself.  As a result, <tt>ioctl()</tt> methods in drivers can
often be pretty small.  The <tt>sbd</tt> driver includes an <tt>ioctl</tt>
method which handles a single command:
</p><p>
</p><pre>    int sbd_ioctl (struct inode *inode, struct file *filp,
                   unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
    {
	long size;
	struct hd_geometry geo;

	switch(cmd) {
	/*
	 * The only command we need to interpret is HDIO_GETGEO, since
	 * we can't partition the drive otherwise.  We have no real
	 * geometry, of course, so make something up.
	 */
	    case HDIO_GETGEO:
		size = Device.size*(hardsect_size/KERNEL_SECTOR_SIZE);
		geo.cylinders = (size &amp; ~0x3f) &gt;&gt; 6;
		geo.heads = 4;
		geo.sectors = 16;
		geo.start = 4;
		if (copy_to_user((void *) arg, &amp;geo, sizeof(geo)))
			return -EFAULT;
		return 0;
        }
        return -ENOTTY; /* unknown command */
    }
</pre>
<p>

The notion of a regular geometry has been fiction for most devices for some
years now.  Tools like <tt>fdisk</tt> still work with cylinders, however,
so a driver must make up some sort of convincing geometry story.  The
<tt>sbd</tt> implementation claims four heads and 16 sectors per cylinder,
but anything else reasonable would have worked as well.



</p><p>
</p><h3>Shutting down</h3>

The last thing to look at is what happens when the module is unloaded.  We
must, of course, clean up our various data structures and free memory - the
usual stuff.  The <tt>sbd</tt> cleanup function looks like this:
<p>
</p><pre>    static void __exit sbd_exit(void)
    {
        del_gendisk(Device.gd);
        put_disk(Device.gd);
        unregister_blkdev(major_num, "sbd");
        blk_cleanup_queue(Queue);
        vfree(Device.data);
    }
</pre>
<p>
<tt>del_gendisk()</tt> cleans up any partitioning information, and
generally makes the system forget about the gendisk passed to it.  The call
to <tt>put_disk()</tt> then releases our reference to the <tt>gendisk</tt>
structure (obtained
when we first called <tt>alloc_disk()</tt>) so that it can be freed.  Then, of
course, we must free the memory used for the device itself (only after the
gendisk has been cleaned up, so we know no more operations can be
requested), release the request queue, and unregister the block device.

</p><p>
</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>

That is about as simple as it gets; the above implements a true virtual
block device that can support a filesystem.  Real drivers, of course, will
tend to be more complicated.  For details on how to make them more
complicated, continue with the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/">Driver

    HI<br>
         ITS ALI, I ALSO ENCOUNTERED THE SAME ERROR WHILE LOADING THAT 
SIMPLE BLOCK DEVICE DRIVER THAT SHOWS MSG LIKE "sbd0: unknown partition 
table"  yet i came to know that it is due to the (add_disk)function call
 in the init function add_disk is necessary as it provide a block disk 
for block I/O's. now i am trying to solve it further if u have solved 
it! let me know coz i am also trying to learn this.<br>
                                                   ALI(SAHIB) <br>

    <div class="FormattedComment"><pre>The "sbd0: unknown partition table" is normal.  The allocated memory is uninitialized when the
module is first loaded so it can't contain a valid partition table.  You can either use sfdisk
or mkfs to create a partition table or file system in the allocated memory.  If mkfs is used,
the driver may subsequently be mounted.

I had to make a few minor changes to the driver to get it to this point.  I had to add the
following line to the sbd_ops structure:
".getgeo = sbd_blk_getgeo"
Then I had to create a function sbd_blk_getgeo with the code from the HDIO_GETGEO case from
the sbd_ioctl function.  This was because sfdisk complained that "Disk /dev/sbd0: cannot get
geometry".

The last thing I had to do was change "geo.start = 4" to geo.start = 0".  This was because
sfdisk complained that "Warning: start=4 - this looks like a partition rather than the entire
disk. Using fdisk on it is probably meaningless."

Once these changes were made, I was able to use sfdisk and mkfs on the device and mount it as
well.

    <div class="FormattedComment"><pre>Just a minor comment/question.

In the sbd_init() function, if the register_blkdev() call fails shouldn't the Queue be removed
(blk_cleanup_queue(Queue);) before the function exits?

    I just ported the simple block driver to 2.6.31 - see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.superpat.com/2010/05/04/a-simple-block-driver-for-linux-kernel-2-6-31/">A Simple Block Driver for Linux Kernel 2.6.31</a>
