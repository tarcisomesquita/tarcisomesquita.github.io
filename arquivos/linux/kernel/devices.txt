2 -> /dev/pts/18

Virtual consoles are named /dev/tty#, with numbering starting at /dev/tty1; /dev/tty0 is the current virtual console.

The console device, /dev/console, is the device to which system messages should be sent, and on which logins should be permitted in single-user mode.
/dev/console is managed by the kernel;

ls -l /dev/ | egrep '^c' | sed 's/^\(.\{27\}\)\(.\{11\}\)/\2\1/' | sort -n | sed 's/^\(.\{11\}\)\(.\{27\}\)/\2\1/' | less

ls -l /dev 2>/dev/null | grep '^c' | \
sed 's/^.* \(.\{3\}\), \(.\{3\}\) .* \([^ ]*\)$/\1, \2 \3/' | \
sed 's/,   /,  0/' | sed 's/,  /, 0/' | sort -n | sed 's/, 0/,  /' | sed 's/,  0/,   /' | less

find /dev/ -exec ls -l '{}' \; 2>/dev/null | grep '^c' | \
sed 's/^.* \([0-9]*\), \([0-9]*\) .* \([^ ]*\)$/ \1 \2 \3/' | sed -n '/ [^ ]\{1,\} [^ ]\{1,\} [^ ]\{1,\}/p' | \

		*most* distributions the appropriate options are
		"mode=0620,gid=<gid of the "tty" group>".)
