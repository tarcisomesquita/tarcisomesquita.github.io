interface descriptors contain fields that are related to classification: class, sub-class and protocol.

CLASSES
A USB device can either use a custom driver or use one already present in the system and this is based on the concept of a device class. This means that if a device belongs to a certain class, then other devices belonging to the same class can make use of the same device driver.
Some of these classes are:
> USB HID (Human Interface Devices) class which covers input devices like keyboards and mice;
> USB Mass Storage devices class which covers devices like pen drives, digital cameras, audio players etc;
> USB CDC (Communication Devices Class) which essentially covers USB modems and similar devices.
