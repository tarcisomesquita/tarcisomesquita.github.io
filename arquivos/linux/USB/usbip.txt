Description: USB device sharing system over IP network
 USB/IP is a system for sharing USB devices over the network.
 .
 To share USB devices between computers with their full
 functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP
 packets and transmits them between computers.
 .
 Original USB device drivers and applications can be used
 for remote USB devices without any modification of them. A
 computer can use remote USB devices as if they were
 directly attached.
 .
 Currently USB/IP provides no access control or encryption.
 It should only be used in trusted environments.
 .
 USB/IP requires kernel support which is included in Linux
 kernels 2.6.28 or newer.
 .
 This package provides the server component 'usbipd' and the
 client tool 'usbip'.
