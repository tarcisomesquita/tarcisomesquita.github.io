              of a hardware bus analyser which is capturing all the USB traffic 
              involved when a mouse is plugged in. Let us emphasise straight away 
              that this is just a typical sequence, which can vary widely depending

                    shown below, the analyser has been set to display only Bus 
                    States, and the highest level Transfers. Each Control Transfer 
                    shown is made up of a series of transactions, each of which 
                    is made up of a series of packets, as we shall see later.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The capture begins 
                    1.9 seconds before the mouse is plugged in. The analyser indicates 
                    that the device has been plugged in, and that it a low speed 
                    device (because the pull-up resistor is on D-). After 3 ms, 
                    because the host is not yet allowed to send any data, the 
                    device is SUSPENDED because of not seeing any activity on 
                    the data lines. Shortly afterwards, the host issues a RESET 
                    which in this case lasted 31 ms</font>.</p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It then performs 
                    a Get Descriptor request (to the default address 0), to discover 
                    the maximum packet size defined for the control endpoint. 
                    Having got this information, it resets the device again, and 
                    then sends a Set Address request, setting device address to 
                    1 in this example.</font></p>

                    from now on are sent to device address 1. The host has now 
                    requested the device descriptor. (<a href="http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/ums_ms_desc_dev.htm" target="_blank">Click 
                    here</a> to see analysis of the device descriptor in a separate 
                    window). It has also requested the first nine bytes of the 
                    configuration descriptor collection. Remember that when the 
                    host requests the configuration descriptor, it will also get, 
                    following it, the interface and endpoint descriptors and maybe 
                    others. But the host doesn't know the total length of this 
                    collection. It does, however, know that the configuration 
                    descriptor itself is 9 bytes long, and that this descriptor 
                    contains a value for the total length of the descriptor collection. 
                    So it starts by requesting just the configuration descriptor 
                    using Get Configuration Descriptor with a required length 
                    of 9. (<a href="http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/ums_ms_desc_conf.htm" target="_blank">Click

                    has been assigned to the product description string.</font></p>

                    be seen that the host has asked for much of the information 
                    again. This can occur for various reasons, such as the different 
                    drivers in the stack each asking the same questions for their 
                    own purposes.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The host has then 
                    sent the Set Configuration request, and from that point in 
                    time, the device is 'configured' and is able to perform its 
                    purpose in life. The host is now able to send the HID class 
                    request 'Set Idle', to tell the device only to respond to 
                    an interrupt IN transaction if a new event occurs. (<i>In 
                    any case when an IN request is sent and there is no change 
                    to report, the device will respond with a NAK packet. The 
                    analyser has been set not to display these 'NAKed' transactions 
                    so we will not see them here</i>) It then also requests the 
                    HID class report descriptor, which in this case informs the 
                    appropriate driver to expect to receive a 4 byte report of 
                    mouse events on its interrupt IN endpoint.</font></p>

                    we might have selected the configuration descriptor set to 
                    display in analysed form. The interface descriptor tells us, 
                    and the host, that it is a HID class device. The bInterfaceSubClass 
                    is usually 0 in HID class devices except for a mouse or a 
                    keyboard which meet the simplified protocol requirements for 
                    being operated by the BIOS code, before the usual USB drivers 
                    have been loaded. In this case we notice that the device will 
                    work with the boot interface and (from bInterfaceProtocol) 
                    that it is a mouse. The usual HID driver will learn about 
                    this in another way; by parsing the HID report descriptor.</font></p>

                    interrogated once every 10 ms and expects the host to read

                    up to 4 bytes long at intervals of 10 ms (or possibly less,

                    is configured, the picture above represents the communication 
                    channels possible in the mouse. It still has the bi-directional 
                    control endpoint, and can receive the six HID class requests 
                    shown in the picture, and it has the interrupt IN endpoint, 
                    for sending its reports of mouse events. Typically, and in 
                    our example here, the only class request out of the 6 defined 
                    HID requests which is used, is the Set Idle request.</font></p>

                    the Get HID Report descriptor to analyse. The display below 
                    shows the contents and significance of the HID report descriptor, 
                    which, using a form of coding specified in the HID specification, 
                    defines one or more reports which are the means of transferring 
                    information to or from a HID device. The parsed form of the 
                    report desriptor is shown below. Parsing a HID report is a 
                    fairly complex operation, so the analyser has helped out by 
                    displaying the defined reports, or in this case the one report 
                    defined. It is a single Input report, with 5 buttons, and 
                    X and Y movement, and a wheel movement, which make up a total 
                    of 4 bytes to match the maximum size of the interrupt endpoint.</font></p>
