Protocol Overhead
(Based on 480 Mb/s and 8 bit interpacket gap, 8 bit min bus turnaround, 32 bit sync, 8 bit EOP: (3x4 SYNC bytes, 3 PID bytes, 2 EP/ADDR+CRC bytes, 2 CRC16 and a 3x(1+11) byte interpacket delay(EOP, etc.))


 Bus Protocol
The Host Controller initiates all data transfers.

Most bus transactions involve the transmission of up to three packets. Each transaction begins when the
Host Controller, on a scheduled basis, sends a USB packet describing the type and direction of transaction,
the USB device address, and endpoint number.


A transaction of a particular transfer type typically requires multiple packets. The protocol overhead for
each transaction includes:
    •    A SYNC field for each packet: either 8 bits (full-/low-speed) or 32 bits (high-speed)
    •    A PID byte for each packet: includes PID and PID invert (check) bits
    •    An EOP for each packet: 3 bits (full-/low-speed) or 8 bits (high-speed)
    •    In a token packet, the endpoint number, device address, and CRC5 fields (16 bits total)
     •   In a data packet, CRC16 fields (16 bits total)
     •   In a data packet, any data field (8 bits per byte)
     •   For transaction with multiple packets, the inter packet gap or bus turnaround time required.
For these calculations, there is assumed to be no bit-stuffing required.
Using the low speed interrupt OUT as an example, there are 5 packets in the transaction:
     •   A PRE special packet
     •   A token packet
     •   A PRE special packet
     •   A data packet
     •   A handshake packet
There is one bus turnaround between the data and handshake packets. The protocol overhead is therefore:
     5 SYNC, 5 PID, Endpoint + CRC5, CRC16, 5 EOPs and interpacket delay (one bus turnaround, 1 delay
     between packets, and 2 hub setup times).
