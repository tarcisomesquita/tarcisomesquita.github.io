rec_len
If an entry cannot completely fit in one block, it must be pushed to the next data block and the rec_len of the previous entry properly adjusted. 

file_type
Constant Name      Value   Description
EXT2_FT_UNKNOWN    0       Unknown File Type
EXT2_FT_REG_FILE   1       Regular File

To improve performances hashed index is used.
Bit EXT2-INDEX-FL in the i_flags of the directory inode is set if the indexed directory format is used.
