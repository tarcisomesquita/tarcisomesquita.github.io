File Allocation Table (FAT)

Reserved Region
FAT Region
File and Directory Data Region


File and Directory Data Region is divided into clusters. The FAT describes which clusters are used by which files.

root_cluster:  dd 0x00000002         ; 0x0000002C   first cluster of the root directory  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . [OK]
Unlike other directories, the root directory itself on any FAT type does not have any date or time stamps, does not have a file name (other than the implied file name "\"), and does not contain "." and ".." files as the first two directory entries in the directory.


sec_per_clus:  db 0x04               ; 0x0000000D   sectors per cluster. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
reserved:      dw 0x0020             ; 0x0000000E   reserved sectors (sectors before the first FAT)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . [OK]
fats:          db 0x02               ; 0x00000010   number of FATs (copy)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . [OK]

The File Allocation Table has one entry per cluster.

first two entries of the FAT are unused
In the first byte of the first entry a copy of the media descriptor is stored.
The remaining bits of this entry are 1.

The high order two bits of the second entry are sometimes, in the case of FAT16 and FAT32, used for dirty volume management:
high order bit 1: last shutdown was clean
next highest bit 1: during the previous mount no disk I/O errors were detected. 

FAT32 entries are 32 bits of which the top 4 bits are reserved.
Possible values for FAT32 are:
00000000: free
00000002-0fffffef: cluster in use; the value given is the number of the next cluster in the file
0ffffff0-0ffffff6: reserved
0ffffff7: bad cluster
0ffffff8-0fffffff: cluster in use, the last one in this file.

The maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 GiB minus 1 byte (2^32âˆ’1 bytes).
