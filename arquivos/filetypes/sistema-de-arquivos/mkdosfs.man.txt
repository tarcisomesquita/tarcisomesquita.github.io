DESCRIPTION
       mkdosfs is used to create an MS-DOS file system under Linux on a device

       device is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).

       block-count is the number of blocks  on the device.
       If omitted, mkdosfs automatically determines the file system size.

OPTIONS
mkdosfs will always use 2 sectors per cluster

12 bit FAT is used only for file systems that have one of the usual floppy sizes (720k, 1.2M, 1.44M, 2.88M), a 16 bit FAT  otherwise.
This can be overridden with the -F option.

       -b sector-of-backup
              Selects  the  location  of  the  backup  boot  sector for FAT32.
              Default depends on number of reserved sectors,  but  usually  is
              sector  6.  The backup must be within the range of reserved sec‐
              tors.

       -c     Check the device for bad blocks before creating the file system.

       -C     Create  the  file given as device on the command line, and write
              the to-be-created file system to it. This can be used to  create
              the  new  file system in a file instead of on a real device, and
              to avoid using dd in advance to create  a  file  of  appropriate
              size.  With  this option, the block-count must be given, because
              otherwise the intended size  of  the  file  system  wouldn’t  be
              known.  The  file  created is a sparse file, which actually only
              contains the meta-data areas (boot sector, FATs, and root direc‐
              tory).  The  data  portions won’t be stored on the disk, but the
              file nevertheless will have the correct size. The resulting file
              can be copied later to a floppy disk or other device, or mounted
              through a loop device.

       -f number-of-FATs
              Specify the number of file allocation tables in the file system.
              The  default  is 2.  Currently the Linux MS-DOS file system does
              not support more than 2 FATs.

       -F FAT-size
              Specifies the type of file allocation tables used (12, 16 or  32
              bit).   If  nothing  is  specified,  mkdosfs  will automatically
              select between 12, 16 and 32 bit, whatever fits better  for  the
              file system size.

       -h number-of-hidden-sectors
              Select  the  number  of hidden sectors in the volume. Apparently
              some digital cameras get indigestion if you feed them a CF  card
              without  such  hidden sectors, this option allows you to satisfy
              them. Assumes ´0´ if no value is given on the command line.

       -i  volume-id
              Sets the volume ID of the newly created file  system;  volume-id
              is  a  32-bit  hexadecimal  number (for example, 2e24ec82).  The
              default is a number which depends on the  file  system  creation
              time.

       -I     default, you are not permitted to create a filesystem across the
              entire  device.   mkdosfs  will  complain  and  tell you that it
              refuses to work.
              This switch will force mkdosfs to work properly.

       -l filename
              Read the bad blocks list from filename.

       -m message-file
              Sets the message the user receives on attempts to boot this file
              system without having properly installed  an  operating  system.
              The  message file must not exceed 418 bytes once line feeds have
              been converted to carriage return-line  feed  combinations,  and
              tabs  have  been expanded.  If the filename is a hyphen (-), the
              text is taken from standard input.

       -n volume-name
              Sets the volume name (label) of the  file  system.   The  volume
              name  can be up to 11 characters long.  The default is no label.

       -r root-dir-entries
              Select the number of entries available in  the  root  directory.
              The default is 112 or 224 for floppies and 512 for hard disks.

       -R number-of-reserved-sectors
              Select  the  number  of  reserved  sectors. With FAT32 format at
              least 2 reserved sectors are needed, the default is  32.  Other‐
              wise the default is 1 (only the boot sector).

       -s sectors-per-cluster
              Specify the number of disk sectors per cluster.  Must be a power
              of 2, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, ... 128.

       -S logical-sector-size
              Specify the number of bytes per logical sector.  Must be a power
              of  2  and  greater  than or equal to 512, i.e. 512, 1024, 2048,
              4096, 8192, 16384, or 32768.

       -v     Verbose execution.
