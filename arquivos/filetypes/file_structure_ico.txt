typdef struct
{
   BITMAPINFOHEADER   icHeader;      // DIB header
   RGBQUAD         icColors[1];   // Color table
   BYTE            icXOR[1];      // DIB bits for XOR mask
   BYTE            icAND[1];      // DIB bits for AND mask
} ICONIMAGE, *LPICONIMAGE;
The icHeader member has the form of a DIB BITMAPINFOHEADER. Only the following members are used: biSize, biWidth, biHeight, biPlanes, biBitCount, biSizeImage. All other members must be 0. The biHeight member specifies the combined height of the XOR and AND masks. The members of icHeader define the contents and sizes of the other elements of the ICONIMAGE structure in the same way that the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure defines a CF_DIB format DIB.

The icColors member is an array of RGBQUADs. The number of elements in this array is determined by examining the icHeader member.

The icXOR member contains the DIB bits for the XOR mask of the image. The number of bytes in this array is determined by examining the icHeader member. The XOR mask is the color portion of the image and is applied to the destination using the XOR operation after the application of the AND mask.

The icAND member contains the bits for the monochrome AND mask. The number of bytes in this array is determined by examining the icHeader member, and assuming 1bpp. The dimensions of this bitmap must be the same as the dimensions of the XOR mask. The AND mask is applied to the destination using the AND operation, to preserve or remove destination pixels before applying the XOR mask
