  There are weakly-typed and strongly-typed VariFields.
<br>
  Weakly-typed VariFields allow to store a portion of any character
  data in the .DBF field itself, with any additional amount, if any, being
  automatically stored in the MEMO file. This substantially reduces the
  amount of disk space required to store the data.  This is sort of a cross
  between using a CHARACTER field and a MEMO field at the same time.
<br>
  A 6 byte pointer is maintained at the end of the weakly-typed "V" field
  entry within the DBF file.  When you define the field width for a new
  database file, keep in mind that weakly-typed "V" fields require this
  additional 6 bytes at the end.  
<br>
  Strongly-typed VariFields store DATE values in only three bytes, instead
  of eight, and LONG INTEGER values (up to ~2G) in only 4 bytes.  Any "V"
  field defined with 4 bytes is automatically considered a strongly-typed
  integer, and "V" fields defined with 3 bytes are automatically considered
  strongly-typed DATE values.  No additional space is required (6-byte
  pointer) for strongly typed VariFields.
