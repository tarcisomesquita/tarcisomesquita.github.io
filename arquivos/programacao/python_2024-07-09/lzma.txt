Reading in a compressed file:

import lzma
with lzma.open("file.xz") as f:
    file_content = f.read()

Creating a compressed file:

import lzma
data = b"Insert Data Here"
with lzma.open("file.xz", "w") as f:
    f.write(data)

Compressing data in memory:

import lzma
data_in = b"Insert Data Here"
data_out = lzma.compress(data_in)

Writing compressed data to an already-open file:

import lzma
with open("file.xz", "wb") as f:
    f.write(b"This data will not be compressed\n")
    with lzma.open(f, "w") as lzf:
        lzf.write(b"This *will* be compressed\n")
    f.write(b"Not compressed\n")
