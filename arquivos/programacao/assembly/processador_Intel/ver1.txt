PRIVILEGED INSTRUCTIONS
Some of the system instructions (called “privileged instructions”) are protected from
use by application programs. The privileged instructions control system functions
(such as the loading of system registers). They can be executed only when the CPL is
0 (most privileged). If one of these instructions is executed when the CPL is not 0, a
Vol. 3 4-33PROTECTION
general-protection exception (#GP) is generated. The following system instructions
are privileged instructions:
LGDT — Load GDT register.
LLDT — Load LDT register.
LTR — Load task register.
LIDT — Load IDT register.
MOV (control registers) — Load and store control registers.
LMSW — Load machine status word.
CLTS — Clear task-switched flag in register CR0.
MOV (debug registers) — Load and store debug registers.
INVD — Invalidate cache, without writeback.
WBINVD — Invalidate cache, with writeback.
INVLPG —Invalidate TLB entry.
HLT— Halt processor.
RDMSR — Read Model-Specific Registers.
WRMSR —Write Model-Specific Registers.
RDPMC — Read Performance-Monitoring Counter.
RDTSC — Read Time-Stamp Counter.


Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)

The LIDT (load IDT register) and SIDT (store IDT register) instructions load and store
the contents of the IDTR register, respectively. The LIDT instruction loads the IDTR
register with the base address and limit held in a memory operand. This instruction
can be executed only when the CPL is 0. It normally is used by the initialization code
of an operating system when creating an IDT. An operating system also may use it to
change from one IDT to another. The SIDT instruction copies the base and limit value
stored in IDTR to memory. This instruction can be executed at any privilege level.
