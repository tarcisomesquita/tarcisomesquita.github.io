<h4><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Data sections, .bss, .rdata,
.data</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The .bss section represents
uninitialized data for the application, including all variables
declared as static within a function or source module.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The .rdata section represents
read-only data, such as literal strings, constants, and debug
directory information.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">All other variables (except
automatic variables, which appear on the stack) are stored in the
.data section. Basically, these are application or module global
variables.</font></p>

<h4><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Resources section, .rsrc</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The .rsrc section contains
resource information for a module. It begins with a resource
directory structure like most other sections, but this section's
data is further structured into a resource tree. The <b>IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY</b>,
shown below, forms the root and nodes of the tree.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">typedef struct _IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY {
    ULONG   Characteristics;
    ULONG   TimeDateStamp;
    USHORT  MajorVersion;
    USHORT  MinorVersion;
    USHORT  NumberOfNamedEntries;
    USHORT  NumberOfIdEntries;
} IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY;
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Looking at the directory
structure, you won't find any pointer to the next nodes. Instead,
there are two fields, <i>NumberOfNamedEntries</i> and <i>NumberOfIdEntries</i>,
used to indicate how many entries are attached to the directory.
By <i>attached</i>, I mean the directory entries follow
immediately after the directory in the section data. The named
entries appear first in ascending alphabetical order, followed by
the ID entries in ascending numerical order.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">A directory entry consists of two
fields, as described in the following <b>IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY</b>
structure:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">typedef struct _IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY {
    ULONG   Name;
    ULONG   OffsetToData;
} IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY, *PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY;
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The two fields are used for
different things depending on the level of the tree. The <i>Name</i>
field is used to identify either a type of resource, a resource
name, or a resource's language ID. The <i>OffsetToData</i> field
is always used to point to a sibling in the tree, either a
directory node or a leaf node.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Leaf nodes are the lowest node in
the resource tree. They define the size and location of the
actual resource data. Each leaf node is represented using the
following <b>IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY</b> structure:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">typedef struct _IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY {
    ULONG   OffsetToData;
    ULONG   Size;
    ULONG   CodePage;
    ULONG   Reserved;
} IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY, *PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY;
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The two fields <i>OffsetToData</i>
and <i>Size</i> indicate the location and size of the actual
resource data. Since this information is used primarily by
functions once the application has been loaded, it makes more
sense to make the <i>OffsetToData</i> field a relative virtual
address. This is precisely the case. Interestingly enough, all
other offsets, such as pointers from directory entries to other
directories, are offsets relative to the location of the root
node.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">To make all of this a little
clearer, consider Figure 2.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><img src="The%20Portable%20Executable%20File%20Format_arquivos/pef2034c.gif" alt="[PE ResourceTree 12787 bytes ]" width="788" height="587"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>Figure 2. A simple resource
tree structure</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Figure 2 depicts a very simple
resource tree containing only two resource objects, a menu, and a
string table. Further, the menu and string table have only one
item each. Yet, you can see how complicated the resource tree
becomes--even with as few resources as this.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">At the root of the tree, the first
directory has one entry for each type of resource the file
contains, no matter how many of each type there are. In Figure 2,
there are two entries identified by the root, one for the menu
and one for the string table. If there had been one or more
dialog resources included in the file, the root node would have
had one more entry and, consequently, another branch for the
dialog resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The basic resource types are
identified in the file WINUSER.H and are listed below:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINUSER.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">/*
 * Predefined Resource Types
 */
#define RT_CURSOR           MAKEINTRESOURCE(1)
#define RT_BITMAP           MAKEINTRESOURCE(2)
#define RT_ICON             MAKEINTRESOURCE(3)
#define RT_MENU             MAKEINTRESOURCE(4)
#define RT_DIALOG           MAKEINTRESOURCE(5)
#define RT_STRING           MAKEINTRESOURCE(6)
#define RT_FONTDIR          MAKEINTRESOURCE(7)
#define RT_FONT             MAKEINTRESOURCE(8)
#define RT_ACCELERATOR      MAKEINTRESOURCE(9)
#define RT_RCDATA           MAKEINTRESOURCE(10)
#define RT_MESSAGETABLE     MAKEINTRESOURCE(11)
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">At the top level of the tree, the
MAKEINTRESOURCE values listed above are placed in the <i>Name</i>
field of each type entry, identifying the different resources by
type.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Each of the entries in the root
directory points to a sibling node in the second level of the
tree. These nodes are directories, too, each having their own
entries. At this level, the directories are used to identify the
name of each resource within a given type. If you had multiple
menus defined in your application, there would be an entry for
each one here at the second level of the tree.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">As you are probably already aware,
resources can be identified by name or by integer. They are
distinguished in this level of the tree via the <i>Name</i> field
in the directory structure. If the most significant bit of the <i>Name</i>
field is set, the other 31 bits are used as an offset to an <b>IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIR_STRING_U</b>
structure.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">typedef struct _IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIR_STRING_U {
    USHORT  Length;
    WCHAR   NameString[ 1 ];
} IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIR_STRING_U, *PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIR_STRING_U;
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">This structure is simply a 2-byte <i>Length</i>
field followed by <i>Length</i> UNICODE characters.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">On the other hand, if the most
significant bit of the <i>Name</i> field is clear, the lower 31
bits are used to represent the integer ID of the resource. Figure
2 shows the menu resource as a named resource and the string
table as an ID resource.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">If there were two menu resources,
one identified by name and one by resource, they would both have
entries immediately after the menu resource directory. The named
resource entry would appear first, followed by the
integer-identified resource. The directory fields <i>NumberOfNamedEntries</i>
and <i>NumberOfIdEntries</i> would each contain the value 1,
indicating the presence of one entry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Below level two, the resource tree
does not branch out any further. Level one branches into
directories representing each type of resource, and level two
branches into directories representing each resource by
identifier. Level three maps a one-to-one correspondence between
the individually identified resources and their respective
language IDs. To indicate the language ID of a resource, the <i>Name</i>
field of the directory entry structure is used to indicate both
the primary language and sublanguage ID for the resource. For the
value 0x0409, 0x09 represents the primary language as
LANG_ENGLISH, and 0x04 is defined as SUBLANG_ENGLISH_CAN for the
sublanguage. The entire set of language IDs is defined in the
file WINNT.H.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Since the language ID node is the
last directory node in the tree, the <i>OffsetToData</i> field in
the entry structure is an offset to a leaf node--the <b>IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY</b>
structure mentioned earlier.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Referring back to Figure 2, you
can see one data entry node for each language directory entry.
This node simply indicates the size of the resource data and the
relative virtual address where the resource data is located.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">One advantage to having so much
structure to the resource data section, .rsrc, is that you can
glean a great deal of information from the section without
accessing the resources themselves. For example, you can find out
how many there are of each type of resource, what resources--if
any--use a particular language ID, whether a particular resource
exists or not, and the size of individual types of resources. To
demonstrate how to make use of this information, the following
function shows how to determine the different types of resources
a file includes:</font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">int     WINAPI GetListOfResourceTypes (
    LPVOID    lpFile,
    HANDLE    hHeap,
    char      **pszResTypes)
{
    PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY          prdRoot;
    PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY    prde;
    char                               *pMem;
    int                                nCnt, i;


    /* Get root directory of resource tree. */
    if ((prdRoot = PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY)ImageDirectoryOffset
           (lpFile, IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE)) == NULL)
        return 0;

    /* Allocate enough space from heap to cover all types. */
    nCnt = prdRoot-&gt;NumberOfIdEntries * (MAXRESOURCENAME + 1);
    *pszResTypes = (char *)HeapAlloc (hHeap,
                                      HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,
                                      nCnt);
    if ((pMem = *pszResTypes) == NULL)
        return 0;

    /* Set pointer to first resource type entry. */
    prde = (PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY)((DWORD)prdRoot +
               sizeof (IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY));

    /* Loop through all resource directory entry types. */
    for (i=0; i&lt;prdRoot-&gt;NumberOfIdEntries; i++)
        {
        if (LoadString (hDll, prde-&gt;Name, pMem, MAXRESOURCENAME))
            pMem += strlen (pMem) + 1;

        prde++;
        }

    return nCnt;
}
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">This function returns a list of
resource type names in the string identified by <i>pszResTypes</i>.
Notice that, at the heart of this function, <b>LoadString</b> is
called using the <i>Name</i> field of each resource type
directory entry as the string ID.of resource type strings whose
IDs are defined the same as the type specifiers in the directory
entries.It would be rather easy to expand on these functions or
write new functions that extracted other information from this
section.</font></p>

<h4><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Export data section, .edata</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The .edata section contains export
data for an application or DLL. When present, this section
contains an export directory for getting to the export
information.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">typedef struct _IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY {
    ULONG   Characteristics;
    ULONG   TimeDateStamp;
    USHORT  MajorVersion;
    USHORT  MinorVersion;
    ULONG   Name;
    ULONG   Base;
    ULONG   NumberOfFunctions;
    ULONG   NumberOfNames;
    PULONG  *AddressOfFunctions;
    PULONG  *AddressOfNames;
    PUSHORT *AddressOfNameOrdinals;
} IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY;
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The <i>Name</i> field in the
export directory identifies the name of the executable module. <i>NumberOfFunctions</i>
and <i>NumberOfNames</i> fields indicate how many functions and
function names are being exported from the module.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The <i>AddressOfFunctions</i>
field is an offset to a list of exported function entry points.
The <i>AddressOfNames</i> field is the address of an offset to
the beginning of a null-separated list of exported function
names. <i>AddressOfNameOrdinals</i> is an offset to a list of
ordinal values (each 2 bytes long) for the same exported
functions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The three <i>AddressOf...</i>
fields are relative virtual addresses into the address space of a
process once the module has been loaded. Once the module is
loaded, the relative virtual address should be added to the
module base address to get the exact location in the address
space of the process. Before the file is loaded, however, the
address can be determined by subtracting the section header
virtual address (<i>VirtualAddress</i>) from the given field
address, adding the section body offset (<i>PointerToRawData</i>)
to the result, and then using this value as an offset into the
image file. The following example illustrates this technique:</font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">int  WINAPI GetExportFunctionNames (
    LPVOID    lpFile,
    HANDLE    hHeap,
    char      **pszFunctions)
{
    IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER       sh;
    PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY    ped;
    char                       *pNames, *pCnt;
    int                        i, nCnt;

    /* Get section header and pointer to data directory 
       for .edata section. */
    if ((ped = (PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY)ImageDirectoryOffset
            (lpFile, IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT)) == NULL)
        return 0;
    GetSectionHdrByName (lpFile, &amp;sh, ".edata");

    /* Determine the offset of the export function names. */
    pNames = (char *)(*(int *)((int)ped-&gt;AddressOfNames -
                               (int)sh.VirtualAddress   +
                               (int)sh.PointerToRawData +
                               (int)lpFile)    -
                      (int)sh.VirtualAddress   +
                      (int)sh.PointerToRawData +
                      (int)lpFile);

    /* Figure out how much memory to allocate for all strings. */
    pCnt = pNames;
    for (i=0; i&lt;(int)ped-&gt;NumberOfNames; i++)
        while (*pCnt++);
    nCnt = (int)(pCnt. pNames);

    /* Allocate memory off heap for function names. */
    *pszFunctions = HeapAlloc (hHeap, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, nCnt);

    /* Copy all strings to buffer. */
    CopyMemory ((LPVOID)*pszFunctions, (LPVOID)pNames, nCnt);

    return nCnt;
}
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Notice that in this function the
variable <i>pNames</i> is assigned by determining first the
address of the offset and then the actual offset location. Both
the address of the offset and the offset itself are relative
virtual addresses and must be translated before being used, as
the function demonstrates. You could write a similar function to
determine the ordinal values or entry points of the functions.</font></p>




<h4><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Debug information section, .debug</font></h4>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Debug information is initially
placed in the .debug section. The PE file format also supports
separate debug files (normally identified with a .DBG extension)
as a means of collecting debug information in a central location.
The debug section contains the debug information, but the debug
directories live in the .rdata section mentioned earlier. Each of
those directories references debug information in the .debug
section. The debug directory structure is defined as an <b>IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY</b>,
as follows:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">typedef struct _IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY {
    ULONG   Characteristics;
    ULONG   TimeDateStamp;
    USHORT  MajorVersion;
    USHORT  MinorVersion;
    ULONG   Type;
    ULONG   SizeOfData;
    ULONG   AddressOfRawData;
    ULONG   PointerToRawData;
} IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY;
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The section is divided into
separate portions of data representing different types of debug
information. For each one there is a debug directory described
above. The different types of debug information are listed below:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL"><b>WINNT.H</b></font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">#define IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_UNKNOWN          0
#define IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_COFF             1
#define IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_CODEVIEW         2
#define IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_FPO              3
#define IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_MISC             4
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The <i>Type</i> field in each
directory indicates which type of debug information the directory
represents. As you can see in the list above, the PE file format
supports many different types of debug information, as well as
some other informational fields. Of those, the <b>IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_MISC</b>
information is unique. This information was added to represent
miscellaneous information about the executable image that could
not be added to any of the more structured data sections in the
PE file format. This is the only location in the image file where
the image name is sure to appear. If an image exports
information, the export data section will also include the image
name.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">Each type of debug information has
its own header structure that defines its data. Each of these is
listed in the file WINNT.H. One nice thing about the <b>IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY</b>
structure is that it includes two fields that identify the debug
information. The first of these, <i>AddressOfRawData</i>, is the
relative virtual address of the data once the file is loaded. The
other, <i>PointerToRawData</i>, is an actual offset within the PE
file, where the data is located. This makes it easy to locate
specific debug information.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">As a last example, consider the
following function, which extracts the image name from the <b>IMAGE_DEBUG_MISC</b>
structure:</font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">int    WINAPI RetrieveModuleName (
    LPVOID    lpFile,
    HANDLE    hHeap,
    char      **pszModule)
{

    PIMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY    pdd;
    PIMAGE_DEBUG_MISC         pdm = NULL;
    int                       nCnt;

    if (!(pdd = (PIMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY)ImageDirectoryOffset
               (lpFile, IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG)))
        return 0;

    while (pdd-&gt;SizeOfData)
        {
        if (pdd-&gt;Type == IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_MISC)
            {
            pdm = (PIMAGE_DEBUG_MISC)
                ((DWORD)pdd-&gt;PointerToRawData + (DWORD)lpFile);

            nCnt = lstrlen (pdm-&gt;Data)*(pdm-&gt;Unicode?2:1);
            *pszModule = (char *)HeapAlloc (hHeap,
                                            HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,
                                            nCnt+1;
            CopyMemory (*pszModule, pdm-&gt;Data, nCnt);

            break;
            }

        pdd ++;
        }

    if (pdm != NULL)
        return nCnt;
    else
        return 0;
}
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">As you can see, the structure of
the debug directory makes it relatively easy to locate a specific
type of debug information. Once the <b>IMAGE_DEBUG_MISC</b>
structure is located, extracting the image name is as simple as
invoking the <b>CopyMemory</b> function.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">As mentioned above, debug
information can be stripped into separate .DBG files. The Windows
NT SDK includes a utility called REBASE.EXE that serves this
purpose. For example, in the following statement an executable
image named TEST.EXE is being stripped of debug information:</font></p>

<pre><font size="2" face="COURIER">rebase -b 40000 -x c:\samples\testdir test.exe
</font></pre>

<p><font size="2" face="ARIAL">The debug information is placed in
a new file called TEST.DBG and located in the path specified, in
this case c:\samples\testdir. The file begins with a single <b>IMAGE_SEPARATE_DEBUG_HEADER</b>
structure, followed by a copy of the section headers that exist
in the stripped executable image. Then the .debug section data
follows the section headers. So, right after the section headers
are the series of <b>IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY</b> structures and
their associated data. The debug information itself retains the
same structure as described above for normal image file debug
information.</font></p>

</body></html>
