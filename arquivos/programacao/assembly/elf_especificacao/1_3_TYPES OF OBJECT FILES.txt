TYPES OF OBJECT FILES
There are three types:
* relocatable file holds code and data suitable for linking with other object files to create an executable or a shared object file.
* executable file holds a program suitable for execution; the file specifies how exec(BA_OS) creates a programâ€™s process image.
* shared object file holds code and data suitable for linking in two contexts.  First, the link editor [see dl(SD_CMD)] may process it with other relocatable and shared object files to create another object file.  Second, the dynamic linker combines it with an executable file and other shared objects to create a process image.
