    - 16 triplet BYTEs of R,G,B DAC info for 16 colors;
    - An array of 11 elements, each element being 32 bytes long.
	  Elements appear in the order:
		Modes 00h,01h in 200-line mode for digital displays
		Modes 00h,01h in 400-line mode for analog displays
		Modes 02h,03h in 200-line mode for digital displays
		Modes 02h,03h in 400-line mode for analog displays
		Modes 04h,05h in 200-line mode for digital displays
		Modes 04h,05h in 400-line mode for analog displays
		Mode  06h in 200-line mode for digital displays
		Mode  06h in 400-line mode for analog displays
		Mode  11h
		Mode  13h in 200-line mode for digital displays
		Mode  13h in 400-line mode for analog displays
 
Format of Video Parameter Table element [MCGA only]:
Offset	Size	Description
 00h	BYTE	Columns on screen		  (see 40h:4Ah)
 01h	BYTE	Rows on screen minus one	  (see 40h:84h)
 02h	BYTE	Height of character in scan lines (see 40h:85h)
 03h	WORD	Size of video buffer		  (see 40h:4Ch)
 05h	WORD	??? always zero
 07h 21 BYTEs	Video data registers 00h-14h to port 3D5h indexed by 3D4h
 1Ch	BYTE	PEL Mask to port 3C6h
 1Dh	BYTE	CGA Mode Control to port 3D8h
 1Eh	BYTE	CGA Border Control to port 3D9h

Format of Video Parameter Dynamic Save Area [EGA, VGA only]:
Offset	Size	Description
 00h 16 BYTEs	Last data written to Attribute Controller Palette Registers 0-15
 10h	BYTE	Last data written to Attribute Controller Overscan Register
 11h-FFh	Reserved
		Note: Need for table was that EGA registers were write-only.
		Note: If default values (from the Video Parameter Table) are
		      over-ridden at a mode set by the VGA User Palette Profile
		      Table, then the Dynamic Save Area is updated with the
		      default values, not the User Profile ones.
