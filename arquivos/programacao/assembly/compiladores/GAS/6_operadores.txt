      * Multiplication.
      / Division. Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'
      % Remainder.
      <
      << Shift Left. Same as the C operator `<<'.
      >
      >> Shift Right. Same as the C operator `>>'. 
   2. Intermediate precedence
      | Bitwise Inclusive Or.
      & Bitwise And.
      ^ Bitwise Exclusive Or.
      ! Bitwise Or Not. 
   3. Lowest Precedence
      + Addition. You may not add together arguments from different sections.
      - Subtraction. You may not subtract arguments from different sections.
