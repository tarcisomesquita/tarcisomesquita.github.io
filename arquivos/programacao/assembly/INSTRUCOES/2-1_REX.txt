REX prefixes are a set of 16 bytes: 40H to 4FH.
Only one REX is allowed per instruction.
REX must immediately precede the opcode byte or the escape opcode byte (0FH).
When a REX is used in conjunction with an instruction containing a mandatory prefix, the mandatory prefix must come before the REX.
example, CVTDQ2PD with a REX prefix should have REX placed between F3 and 0F E6.

REX.W can be used to determine the operand width. Like the 66H size prefix.
REX.R modifies the ModR/M reg field when that field encodes a GPR, SSE, control or debug register.
REX.X bit modifies the SIB index field.
REX.B either modifies the base in the ModR/M r/m field or SIB base field; or it modifies the opcode reg field used for accessing GPRs.

Field Name   Bit Position
W            3
R            2
X            1
B            0
