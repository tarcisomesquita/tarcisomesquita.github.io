RET simply pops the value at the top of the stack into the IP. It is the programmer’s responsibility to make sure that when the ret
instruction is being executed, the value at the top of the stack is the return
address that was pushed by the corresponding call.

RET x, acts like ret, but in addition, it discards x number of bytes from the stack after popping the return address into the IP.
This is used to clear the stack of parameters passed during the function call.
