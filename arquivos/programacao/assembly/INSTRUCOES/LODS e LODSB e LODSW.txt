LODS/LODSB/LODSW/LODSD Operand – Load String 1010 110w

O endereco da memória esta em DS:(E)SI

LODS mem
Nao entendi.
Serah que se DS:(E)SI=0 ele carrega diretamente da memoria?
The explicit-operands form (specified with the LODS mnemonic) allows the source operand to be specified explicitly.


LODSB
Load byte at address DS:(E)SI into AL.

LODSW
Load word at address DS:(E)SI into AX.

LODSD
Load dword at address DS:(E)SI into EAX.

After the byte, word, or doubleword is transferred from the memory location into the
AL, AX, or EAX register, the (E)SI register is incremented or decremented automati-
cally according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is
0, the (E)SI register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the ESI register is decre-
mented.) The (E)SI register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations,
by 2 for word operations, or by 4 for doubleword operations.


The LODS, LODSB, LODSW, and LODSD instructions can be preceded by the REP
prefix for block loads of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. More often, however,
these instructions are used within a LOOP construct because further processing of
the data moved into the register is usually necessary before the next transfer can be
made.
