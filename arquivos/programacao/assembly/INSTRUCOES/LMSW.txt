  0F 01 /6     LMSW r/m16       Valid       Valid        Loads r/m16 in machine status word
                                                         of CR0.
 Description
 Loads the source operand into the machine status word, bits 0 through 15 of register
 CR0. The source operand can be a 16-bit general-purpose register or a memory loca-
 tion. Only the low-order 4 bits of the source operand (which contains the PE, MP, EM,
 and TS flags) are loaded into CR0. The PG, CD, NW, AM, WP, NE, and ET flags of CR0
 are not affected. The operand-size attribute has no effect on this instruction.
 If the PE flag of the source operand (bit 0) is set to 1, the instruction causes the
 processor to switch to protected mode. While in protected mode, the LMSW instruc-
 tion cannot be used to clear the PE flag and force a switch back to real-address mode.
 The LMSW instruction is provided for use in operating-system software; it should not
 be used in application programs. In protected or virtual-8086 mode, it can only be
 executed at CPL 0.
 This instruction is provided for compatibility with the Intel 286 processor; programs
 and procedures intended to run on the Pentium 4, Intel Xeon, P6 family, Pentium,
 Intel486, and Intel386 processors should use the MOV (control registers) instruction
 to load the whole CR0 register. The MOV CR0 instruction can be used to set and clear
 the PE flag in CR0, allowing a procedure or program to switch between protected and
 real-address modes.
 This instruction is a serializing instruction.
 This instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode. Note
 that the operand size is fixed at 16 bits.
 See “Changes to Instruction Behavior in VMX Non-Root Operation” in Chapter 21 of
 the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3B, for
 more information about the behavior of this instruction in VMX non-root operation.
 Operation
 CR0[0:3] ←SRC[0:3];
 Flags Affected
 None.

Protected Mode Exceptions
#GP(0)              If the current privilege level is not 0.
                    If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS,
                    ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
                    If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register is used to access memory and it
                    contains a NULL segment selector.
#SS(0)              If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS
                    segment limit.
#PF(fault-code)     If a page fault occurs.
#UD                 If the LOCK prefix is used.
Real-Address Mode Exceptions
#GP                 If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS,
                    ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
#UD                 If the LOCK prefix is used.
Virtual-8086 Mode Exceptions
#GP(0)              If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS,
                    ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
#SS(0)              If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS
                    segment limit.
#PF(fault-code)     If a page fault occurs.
#UD                 If the LOCK prefix is used.
Compatibility Mode Exceptions
Same exceptions as in protected mode.
64-Bit Mode Exceptions
#SS(0)              If a memory address referencing the SS segment is in a non-
                    canonical form.
#GP(0)              If the current privilege level is not 0.
                    If the memory address is in a non-canonical form.
#PF(fault-code)     If a page fault occurs.
#UD                 If the LOCK prefix is used.
