The one-byte NOP instruction is an alias mnemonic for the XCHG (E)AX, (E)AX
instruction.
The multi-byte NOP instruction performs no operation on supported processors
and generates undefined opcode exception on processors that do not support the
multi-byte NOP instruction.

The multi-byte NOP instruction does not alter the content of a register and 
will not issue a memory operation. 

Flags Affected
None.
Exceptions (All Operating Modes)
#UD                 If the LOCK prefix is used.
