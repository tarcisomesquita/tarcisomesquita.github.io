Instruction Prefixes
Up to four prefixes of 1 byte each (optional)

REX
1 byte (optional)

Opcode
1, 2, or 3 byte 

ModR/M
1 byte (if required)

SIB
1 byte (if required)

Displacement
Address displacement of 1, 2, or 4 bytes or none

Immediate
Immediate data of 1, 2, or 4 bytes or none

Two-byte opcode formats for general-purpose and SIMD instructions consist of:
•    An escape opcode byte 0F as the primary opcode and a second opcode byte, or
•    A mandatory prefix (66H, F2H, or F3H), an escape opcode byte, and a second opcode byte (same as previous bullet)
For example, CVTDQ2PD consists of the following sequence: F3 0F E6. The first byte is a mandatory prefix (it is not considered as a repeat prefix).
Three-byte opcode formats for general-purpose and SIMD instructions consist of:
•    An escape opcode byte 0FH as the primary opcode, plus two additional opcode
     bytes, or
•    A mandatory prefix (66H, F2H, or F3H), an escape opcode byte, plus two additional opcode bytes (same as previous bullet)
For example, PHADDW for XMM registers consists of the following sequence: 66 0F 38 01. The first byte is the mandatory prefix.
Valid opcode expressions are defined in Appendix A and Appendix B.
