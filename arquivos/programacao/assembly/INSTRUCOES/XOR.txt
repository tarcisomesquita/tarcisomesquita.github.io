XOR – Logical Exclusive OR
 register1 to register2      0011 000w : 11 reg1 reg2
 register2 to register1      0011 001w : 11 reg1 reg2
 memory to register          0011 001w : mod reg r/m
 register to memory          0011 000w : mod reg r/m
 immediate to register       1000 00sw : 11 110 reg : immediate data
 immediate to AL, AX, or EAX 0011 010w : immediate data
 immediate to memory         1000 00sw : mod 110 r/m : immediate data

Exemplo:
31 h = 0011 0001 b

ed h = 11 101 101 b

31ED          XOR     BP,BP

Flags Affected

The OF and CF flags are cleared; the SF, ZF, and PF flags are set according to the result. The state of the AF flag is undefined.

Protected Mode Exceptions

#GP(0)                If the destination operand points to a non-writable segment.
                      If a memory operand effective address is outside the CS, DS,
                      ES, FS, or GS segment limit.
                      If the DS, ES, FS, or GS register contains a NULL segment
                      selector.
#SS(0)                If a memory operand effective address is outside the SS
                      segment limit.
#PF(fault-code)       If a page fault occurs.
#AC(0)                If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory
                      reference is made while the current privilege level is 3.
#UD                   If the LOCK prefix is used but the destination is not a memory
                      operand.
