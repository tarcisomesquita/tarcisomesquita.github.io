Description

sets the OF and CF flags to indicate a carry (over-flow) in the signed or unsigned result, respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the signed result.
   This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instruction to be executed atomically.
   In 64-bit mode, the instruction’s default operation size is 32 bits. Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Using a REX a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotes operation to 64 bits.
