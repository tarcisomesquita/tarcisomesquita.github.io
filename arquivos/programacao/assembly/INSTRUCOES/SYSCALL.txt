0F 05 SYSCALL  Fast call to privilege level 0 system procedures.
Only for 64.

SYSCALL saves the RIP of the instruction following SYSCALL to RCX and loads a new RIP from the IA32_LSTAR (64-bit mode). Upon return, SYSRET copies the value saved in RCX to the RIP.

SYSCALL saves RFLAGS (lower 32 bit only) in R11. It then masks RFLAGS with an OS-defined value using the IA32_FMASK (MSR C000_0084).
None of the bits in RFLAGS are automatically cleared (except for RF). SYSRET restores RFLAGS from R11 (the lower 32 bits only).

Software should not alter the CS or SS descriptors in a manner that violates the following assumptions made by SYSCALL/SYSRET:
• The CS and SS base and limit remain the same for all processes, including the operating system (the base is 0H and the limit is 0FFFFFFFFH).
• The CS of the SYSCALL target has a privilege level of 0.
• The CS of the SYSRET target has a privilege level of 3.
SYSCALL/SYSRET do not check for violations of these assumptions.
