Read Sectors (02h)

Read a sector from the specified drive into a user-defined buffer.

The read must not span a track or head boundary, and the buffer must not cross a 64KB DMA boundary in the physical address space.


Input Parameters:
AH - 02h, indicating the Read Sectors Function.
AL - Number of sectors.
CH - Bottom 8 bits of track number (0-based).
CL - ttssssss, as follows:
     tt = top two bits of 10-bit track number,
     ssssss = 6-bit sector number (0-17).
DH - Head number (0-based).
DL - Drive number. (Bit 7 set for hard disks)
ES:BX - Address of user buffer.

Output Parameters:
CF - Set if failure, else clear if success.
AH - Disk status code (00h if success).
AL - Number of sectors actually read.
