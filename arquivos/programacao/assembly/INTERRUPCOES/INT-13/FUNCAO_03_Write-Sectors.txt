3.4.4 Write Sectors (03h)
The Write Sectors disk BIOS function is called to write a sector run to the specified drive from a
user-defined buffer. The write must not span a track or head boundary, and the buffer must not
cross a 64KB DMA boundary in the physical address space.
This function returns an error when accessing the ROM disk.
Input Parameters:
        AH - 03h, indicating the Write Sectors Function.
        AL - Number of sectors. (maximo que eu consegui escrever em disquete foi 48h) (0x40 eh meio segmento)
        CH - Bottom 8 bits of track (cylinder) number (0-based).
        CL - ttssssss, as follows:
              tt = top two bits of 10-bit track number,
              ssssss = 6-bit sector number (1-based).
       DH - Head number (0-based).
       DL - Drive number.
       ES:BX - Address of user buffer.
Output Parameters:
       CF - Set if failure, else clear if success.
       AH - Disk status code (00h if success).
       AL - Number of sectors actually written.
