The Read Cache Status BIOS function is called to request the status of the external cache as supported by the BIOS.

Input Parameters:
        AH - F4h, indicating the Cache Control Function.
        AL - 00h, indicating the Read Cache Status Subfunction.

Output Parameters:
        AH - cache status, as follows:
               not modified - no cache status is available.
               E2h - successful, information returned.
        AL - cache controller status, as follows:
               00h - cache controller not present.
               01h - cache memory enabled.
               02h - cache memory disabled.
        CX - cache memory size, as follows:
               Bit 15 - 1 if information invalid, else 0 if valid.
               Bits 14 through 0 - cache memory size in KB.
        DH - cache write strategy, as follows:
               Bit 7 - 1 if information invalid, else 0 if valid.
               Bits 6 through 1 - set to 0's.
               Bit 0 - 0 if write-through, else 1 if write-back.
        DL - cache type, as follows:
               Bit 7 - 1 if information invalid, else 0 if valid.
               Bits 6 through 1 - set to 0's.
