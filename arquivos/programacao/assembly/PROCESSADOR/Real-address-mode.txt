Real-address mode is 16-bit.

supports 1-MByte of RAM divided in segments of 64 kB.

After reset the state of control register CR0 is 60000010H.
The PE flag in CR0 determine if the processor is operating in real-address or protected mode.

Some basic data structures and code modules must be loaded into physical memory to support further initialization of the processor. These data structures include the following:
• A IDT.
• A GDT.
• A TSS.
• (Optional) An LDT.
• If paging is to be used, at least one page directory and one page table.
• A code segment that contains the code to be executed when the processor switches to protected mode.
• One or more code modules that contain the necessary interrupt and exception handlers.
