Structure of segment descriptor entry

    A is the Accessed bit;
    R is the Readable bit;
    C (Bit 42) depends on X:[38]
        if X = 1 then C is the Conforming bit, and determines which privilege levels can far-jump to this segment (without changing privilege level):
            if C = 0 then only code with the same privilege level as DPL may jump here;
            if C = 1 then code with the same or a lower privilege level relative to DPL may jump here.
        if X = 0 then C is the direction bit:
            if C = 0 then the segment grows up;
            if C = 1 then the segment grows down.
    X is the Executable bit:[38]
        if X = 1 then the segment is a code segment;
        if X = 0 then the segment is a data segment.
    S is the Segment type bit, which should generally be cleared for system segments;[38]
    DPL is the Descriptor Privilege Level;
    P is the Present bit;
    D is the Default operand size;
    G is the Granularity bit;
    Bit 52 of the 80386 descriptor is not used by the hardware.
