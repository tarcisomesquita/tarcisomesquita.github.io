classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses

each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.

The class Bicycle becomes the superclass of MountainBike, RoadBike, and TandemBike.

class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

    // new fields and methods defining 
    // a mountain bike would go here

}

This gives MountainBike all the same fields and methods as Bicycle.

you must take care to properly document the state and behavior that each superclass defines, since that code will not appear in the source file of each subclass.
