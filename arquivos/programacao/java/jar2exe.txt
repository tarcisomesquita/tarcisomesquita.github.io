To run an app that’s compiled into a directory of files like this, you have to type

java –classpath MyClassDir MyMainClassName

But some users are gonna be put off by this. It would be nicer if you could just double-click “MyApp.exe” to run, like for a normal app.

We can get closer to that by packaging our .class files into a single JAR (Java ARchive) file. Here’s how you do it:

jar cfm MyApp.jar MyMainClassName MyClassDir/*.class

This makes a single .jar file containing all your .class files, with a “manifest” file inside that tells Java which class is your main class. Then you run it like this

java -jar MyApp.jar
