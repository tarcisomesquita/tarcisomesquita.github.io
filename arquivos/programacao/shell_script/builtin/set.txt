set [{ -options | +options | -- }] arg ...

The set command performs three different functions.

With no arguments, it lists the values of all shell variables.

If options are given, it sets the specified option flags, or clears them as described in the section called Argument List Processing.

As a special case, if the option is -o or +o and no argument is supplied, the shell prints the settings of all its options.
If the option is -o, the settings are printed in a human-readable format;
if the option is +o, the settings are printed in a format suitable for reinput to the shell to affect the same option settings.

The third use of the set command is to set the values of the shell's positional parameters to the specified args.
Por exemplo:
./teste.sh primeiro
#dentro do script
set secundo
#ele ir√° fazer $2=segundo


To change the positional parameters without changing any options, use "--" as the first argument to set.
If no args are present, the set command will clear all the positional parameters (equivalent to executing "shift $#".)
