ulimit [-H | -S] [-a | -tfdscmlpn [value]]

Inquire about or set the hard or soft limits on processes or set
new limits.  The choice between hard limit (which no process is
allowed to violate, and which may not be raised once it has been
lowered) and soft limit (which causes processes to be signaled but
not necessarily killed, and which may be raised) is made with
these flags:

-H          set or inquire about hard limits

-S          set or inquire about soft limits.  If neither -H nor
            -S is specified, the soft limit is displayed or both
            limits are set.  If both are specified, the last one
            wins.

The limit to be interrogated or set, then, is chosen by specifying
any one of these flags:

-a          show all the current limits

-t          show or set the limit on CPU time (in seconds)

-f          show or set the limit on the largest file that can be
            created (in 512-byte blocks)

-d          show or set the limit on the data segment size of a
            process (in kilobytes)

-s          show or set the limit on the stack size of a process
            (in kilobytes)

-c          show or set the limit on the largest core dump size
            that can be produced (in 512-byte blocks)

-m          show or set the limit on the total physical memory
            that can be in use by a process (in kilobytes)

-l          show or set the limit on how much memory a process can
            lock with mlock(2) (in kilobytes)

-p          show or set the limit on the number of processes this
            user can have at one time

-n          show or set the limit on the number files a process
            can have open at once

If none of these is specified, it is the limit on file size that
is shown or set.  If value is specified, the limit is set to that
number; otherwise the current limit is displayed.

Limits of an arbitrary process can be displayed or set using the
sysctl(8) utility.
