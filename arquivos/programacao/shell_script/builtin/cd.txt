cd [-LP] [directory]

Switch to the specified directory (default HOME).
If a single "-" is specified as the argument, it will be replaced by the value of OLDPWD.

The cd command will print out the name of the directory that it actually switched to if this is different from the name that the user gave.

If CDPATH is set and the directory name does not begin with a slash "/", then the directories listed in CDPATH will be searched for the specified directory.
The format of CDPATH is the same as that of PATH.

The -P option causes the physical directory structure to be used, that is, all symbolic links are resolved to their respective values.
The -L option turns off the effect of any preceding -P options.
