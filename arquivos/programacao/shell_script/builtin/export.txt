export name ...

export -p

The specified names are exported so that they will appear in the environment of subsequent commands (as variaveis de ambiente estarão disponíveis para os scripts executados).

The only way to un-export a variable is to unset it.

The shell allows the value of a variable to be set at the same time it is exported by writing
export name=value

With no arguments the export command lists the names of all exported variables.
With the -p option specified the output will be formatted suitably for non-interactive use.
