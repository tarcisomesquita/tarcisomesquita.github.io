echo [-n] args...
Print the arguments on the standard output.

with -n option a newline is not printed in output following the arguments.

If any of the following sequences of characters is encountered during output, the sequence is not output. Instead, the specified action is performed:

\b      A backspace character is output.

\c      Subsequent output is suppressed.  This is normally used at
        the end of the last argument to suppress the trailing new-
        line that echo would otherwise output.

\f      Output a form feed.

\n      Output a newline character.

\r      Output a carriage return.

\t      Output a (horizontal) tab character.

\v      Output a vertical tab.

\0digits
        Output the character whose value is given by zero to three
        octal digits.  If there are zero digits, a nul character
        is output.

\\      Output a backslash.

All other backslash sequences elicit undefined behaviour.


exemplo:
echo \\124
