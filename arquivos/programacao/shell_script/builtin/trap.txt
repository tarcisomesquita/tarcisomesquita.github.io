trap [action signal ...]

Cause the shell to parse and execute action when any of the speci-
fied signals are received.  The signals are specified by signal
number or as the name of the signal.  If signal is 0, the action
is executed when the shell exits.  action may be null, which cause
the specified signals to be ignored.  With action omitted or set
to '-' the specified signals are set to their default action.
When the shell forks off a subshell, it resets trapped (but not
ignored) signals to the default action.  The trap command has no
effect on signals that were ignored on entry to the shell.  trap
without any arguments cause it to write a list of signals and
their associated action to the standard output in a format that is
suitable as an input to the shell that achieves the same trapping
results.

Examples:

      trap

List trapped signals and their corresponding action

      trap '' INT QUIT tstp 30

Ignore signals INT QUIT TSTP USR1

      trap date INT

Print date upon receiving signal INT
