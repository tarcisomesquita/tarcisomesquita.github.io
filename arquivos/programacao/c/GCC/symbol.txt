When you compile static programs, like the hello world program the compiler will automatically link to your program a library called `libc.a'. So when you type

% gcc -c hello.c
% gcc -static -o hello hello.o

what is actually going on behind the scenes is:

% gcc -c hello.c
% gcc -o hello hello.c -lc

To see why this is necessary, try `nm' on `hello.o':

% nm hello.o
00000000 t gcc2_compiled.
00000000 T main
         U printf

The file `hello.o' defines the symbol `main', but it marks the symbol `printf' as undefined.
