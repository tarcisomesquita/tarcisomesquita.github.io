set variable VAR = EXP

Evaluate expression EXP and assign result to variable VAR

VAR may be a debugger "convenience" variable (names starting with $), a register (a few standard names starting with $), or an actual variable in the program being debugged.

EXP is any valid expression.

Use "set variable" for variables with names identical to set subcommands.

With a subcommand, this command modifies parts of the gdb environment.
You can see these environment settings with the "show" command.
