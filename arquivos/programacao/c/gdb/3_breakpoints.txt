break [LOCATION] [thread THREADNUM] [if CONDITION]

Set breakpoint at specified line or function.

LOCATION may be a line number, function name, or "*" and an address.
If a line number is specified, break at start of code for that line.
If a function is specified, break at start of code for that function.
If an address is specified, break at that exact address.
With no LOCATION, uses current execution address of selected stack frame.
This is useful for breaking on return to a stack frame.

THREADNUM is the number from "info threads".
CONDITION is a boolean expression.

Multiple breakpoints at one place are permitted, and useful if conditional.
