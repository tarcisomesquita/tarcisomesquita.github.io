text gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of individual, atomic input elements. Some input elements are insignificant to the interpreter, and will be stripped after this step â€” they include white space and comments. The others, including identifiers, keywords, literals, and punctuators (mostly operators), will be used for further syntax analysis. Line terminators and multiline comments are also syntactically insignificant, but they guide the process for automatic semicolons insertion to make certain invalid token sequences become valid.

White space characters improve the readability of source text and separate tokens from each other. These characters are usually unnecessary for the functionality of the code.
