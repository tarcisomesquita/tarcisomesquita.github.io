A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

identifiers can be described by the regex /[$_\p{ID_Start}][$\u200c\u200d\p{ID_Continue}]*/u
const 你好 = "Hello";
console.log(\u4f60\u597d);

Underscore:
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Lower Camel Case (most used):
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed
3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use let if you can't use const
5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

let carName;
After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).

let x = "5" + 2 + 3; // = "523"
let x = 2 + 3 + "5"; // = "55"
