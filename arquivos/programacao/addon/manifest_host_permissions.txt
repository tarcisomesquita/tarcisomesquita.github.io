Manifest version: 3 or higher

"host_permissions": [
  "*://developer.mozilla.org/*",
  "*://*.example.org/*"
]

Use the host_permissions key to request access for the APIs in your extension that read or modify host data, such as cookies, webRequest, and tabs. This key is an array of strings, and each string is a request for a permission.

The extra privileges include:
 - XMLHttpRequest and fetch access to those origins without cross-origin restrictions
 - the ability to inject scripts programmatically (using tabs.executeScript()) into pages served from those origins.
 - the ability to receive events from the webRequest API for these hosts.
 - the ability to access cookies for that host using the cookies API, as long as the "cookies" API permission is also included.
