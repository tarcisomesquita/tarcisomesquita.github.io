           Record Header


After the header comes the message data. This is compressed by the compression algorithm that has been negotiated
for the connection. However as no compression algorithms are specified for use with TLS or SSL, this is usually a
null operation.

The MAC is then calculated for the compressed data and appended to the record.

            Record Pad

If a block cipher is in effect for the connection then then a pad is added in order for the message size to be a multiple
of the block size of the cipher. The pad consists of padding followed by a byte containing the length of the padding.
The padding itself is also set to the value of the length of the padding. The padding may be any length up to 255
bytes, so long as the length of the resulting record is a multiple of the block length of the cipher.
As an example, if a record is 123 bytes long and the block length is 8 bytes, then a pad length of 4 would make the
combined length of the record, padding and pad length 128 bytes, a multiple of the block length. 12, 20 and 252
are examples of other valid pad lengths. The intention of allowing a range of pad values is to allow the length of the
record to be obscured to some extent.

If the NULL cipher or a stream cipher is in effect then padding is not needed. In practice this occurs during the initial handshake which is conducted in plain-text and if RC4[23, 12] are used.
