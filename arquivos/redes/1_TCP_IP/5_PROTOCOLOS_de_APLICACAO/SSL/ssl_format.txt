SSL record format
There are three record types for SSL version 3 and TLS version 1:

    Handshake
    Alert, which is a warning or fatal error
    Data (application data).

The data in the record has the following characteristics:

    A variable length and starts with a 5-byte record header
    Contains handshake data, alert data, or application data
    Is encrypted, except for the first SSL handshake flows.

The message digest has the following characteristics:

    A fixed length that is based on the digest algorithm used
    Is included only if the data is encrypted.

Format of an SSL record

Byte   0       = SSL record type
Bytes 1-2      = SSL version (major/minor)
Bytes 3-4      = Length of data in the record (excluding the header itself).
                 The maximum SSL supports is 16384 (16K).

Byte 0 in the record has the following record type values:

SSL3_RT_CHANGE_CIPHER_SPEC      20   (x'14')
SSL3_RT_ALERT                   21   (x'15')
SSL3_RT_HANDSHAKE               22   (x'16')
SSL3_RT_APPLICATION_DATA        23   (x'17')

Bytes 1-2 in the record have the following version values:

SSL3_VERSION           x'0300'
TLS1_VERSION           x'0301'

Format of an SSL handshake record

Byte   0       = SSL record type = 22 (SSL3_RT_HANDSHAKE)
Bytes 1-2      = SSL version (major/minor)
Bytes 3-4      = Length of data in the record (excluding the header itself).
Byte   5       = Handshake type
Bytes 6-8      = Length of data to follow in this record
Bytes 9-n      = Command-specific data                      

Byte 5 in the record has the following handshake type values:

SSL3_MT_HELLO_REQUEST            0   (x'00')
SSL3_MT_CLIENT_HELLO             1   (x'01')
SSL3_MT_SERVER_HELLO             2   (x'02')
SSL3_MT_CERTIFICATE             11   (x'0B')
SSL3_MT_SERVER_KEY_EXCHANGE     12   (x'0C')
SSL3_MT_CERTIFICATE_REQUEST     13   (x'0D')
SSL3_MT_SERVER_DONE             14   (x'0E')
SSL3_MT_CERTIFICATE_VERIFY      15   (x'0F')
SSL3_MT_CLIENT_KEY_EXCHANGE     16   (x'10')
SSL3_MT_FINISHED                20   (x'14') 

The ChangeCipherspec type has the following value:

SSL3_MT_CCS       1

Format of an SSL alert record

SSL3_AL_WARNINGS        1
SSL3_AL_FATAL           2

The following shows the alert values for SSL and TLS. Alerts that begin with SSL3 are supported by both SSL version 3 and TLS version 1. Alerts that begin with TLS1 are supported by TLS only.

SSL3_AD_CLOSE_NOTIFY                   0      x'00'
SSL3_AD_UNEXPECTED_MESSAGE            10      x'0A'
SSL3_AD_BAD_RECORD_MAC                20      x'14'
TLS1_AD_DECRYPTION_FAILED             21      x'15'
