/proc/net/*

The relevant /proc/net/ files for IPv4 are: tcp, udp, and raw.
Each following line represents one open socket.
File syntax:
sl                  The number of the line in the output listing.

local_address       The local IP address and port number for the socket. 
                    IP is a little-endian hexadecimal.

rem_address         The remote IP address and port number for the socket.

st                  The socket status.

tx_queue:rx_queue   The size of the transmit and receive queues.

tr:tm->when         The tr field indicates whether a timer is active for this socket.
                    A value of zero indicates the timer is not active.
                    The tm->when field indicates the time remaining before timeout occurs.

retrnsmt            Unused.

uid                 The ID of the user that owns the socket.

time-out            unused.

inode               A cryptic-looking number that identifies the socket to the Linux virtual filesystem.

arp
Lists the kernel's ARP table.

dev
Informações de dispositivos. Show transmit and receive statistics created by driver.

sockstat
Provides socket statistics.

tcp
Contains detailed TCP socket information.

raw
Informação sobre o socket raw.

tcp
Informação sobre o socket TCP.

udp
Informação sobre o socket UDP.

unix
Informação sobre o socket de domínio Unix.

route
Informação sobre os roteamentos IP realizados pelo kernel

ip_masquerade
Conexões mascaradas do kernel



dev_mcast
Lists Layer2 multicast groups on which each device is listening.

igmp
Lists the IP multicast addresses which this system joined.

ip_conntrack
Lists tracked network connections for machines that are forwarding IP connections.

ip_tables_names
Lists the types of iptables in use. Contain values: mangle, raw, nat, filter.

ip_mr_cache
Lists the multicast routing cache.

ip_mr_vif
Lists multicast virtual interfaces.

netstat
Contains a broad yet detailed collection of networking statistics, including TCP timeouts, SYN cookies sent and received, and much more.

psched
Lists global packet scheduler parameters.


route
Lists the kernel's routing table.
the IP addresses and network masks are displayed in byte-reversed hexadecimal.
For example, to convert the remote address and port of line 16 of the /proc/net/tcp output shown in this column, we'd do the following:

• Take the rem_address field:
   0100007F:0017

• Reverse the ordering of the bytes in the IP address part:
   7F000001:0017

• Let's separate the bytes of the address for readability:
   7F 00 00 01 : 0017

• Perform a simple hexadecimal-to-decimal conversion on each:
   127 0 0 1 : 23 

The fields are:

Iface         The network interface that datagrams matching this route will 
              leave.

Destination   In combination with the Mark field, this specifies which data-
              grams will match this route.

Gateway       The IP address of the host that will act as a gateway for data-
              grams matching this route.

Flags         An indicator of a number of route attributes. The flags field 
              values are the RTF_* codings found in the /usr/include/linux/ro-
              ute.h file.

RefCnt        Unused.

Use           Unused.

Metric        The metric value associated with the route. This is used to in-
              dicate the cost or priority of a route.

Mask          In combination with the Destination field, this specifies which 
              datagrams will match this route.

MTU           Specifies the largest TCP segment (in bytes) that will be built 
              for transmission via this route.

Window        Specifies the TCP window (in bytes) that will be advertised for 
              TCP connections made via this route.

IRTT          Specifies the Initial Round Trip time (in milliseconds) that 
              will be used for TCP connections established via this route


rt_cache
Contains the current routing cache.

snmp
It is intended to be used by SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) daemon programs and provides summary statistics for each of the IP, ICMP, TCP, and UDP protocols.
All of the fields are decimal integers excepting the Ip: Forwarding  field, which is a boolean value. In the SNMP world, boolean values are represented with values 1 and 2, so a value of 1 indicates that IP forwarding is disabled.


tr_rif
Lists the token ring RIF routing table.

udp
Contains detailed UDP socket information.

unix
Lists UNIX domain sockets currently in use.

wireless
Lists wireless interface data.
