ifup(8)

DESCRIPTION
       The  ifup  and  ifdown  commands may be used to configure (or, respectively, deconfigure) network interfaces based on interface definitions in the
       file /etc/network/interfaces.

EXAMPLES
       ifup -a
              Bring up all the interfaces defined with auto in /etc/network/interfaces

       ifup eth0
              Bring up interface eth0

       ifup eth0=home
              Bring up interface eth0 as logical interface home

       ifdown -a
              Bring down all interfaces that are currently up.

NOTES
       ifup and ifdown are actually the same program called by different names.
       The program does not configure network interfaces directly; it runs low level utilities such as ifconfig and route to do its dirty work.

/var/run/network/ifstate current state of network interfaces

LIMITATIONS
an interface that was brought up using ifup and later deconfigured using ifconfig will still be recorded as up.  To fix this you can use the --force option to force ifup or ifdown.
