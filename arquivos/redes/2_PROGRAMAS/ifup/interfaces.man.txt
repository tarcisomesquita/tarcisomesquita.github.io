       auto lo eth0

       iface lo inet loopback

       iface eth0-home inet static
            address 192.168.1.1
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            up flush-mail

       iface eth0-work inet dhcp

       iface eth1 inet dhcp

       "auto" are used to identify the physical interfaces to be brought up when ifup is run with the -a option.

IFACE OPTIONS
       If the command fails then ifup aborts, prints an error message, and exits with status 0.
       pre-up command
       up command
       post-up command
       down command
       pre-down command
       post-down command

       There exists for each of the above mentioned options a directory /etc/network/if-<option>.d/ the scripts in which are run (with no arguments)
       using run-parts(8) after the option itself has been processed.

       All of these commands have access to the following environment variables.
       IFACE  physical name of the interface being processed
       LOGICAL logical name of the interface being processed
       ADDRFAM address family of the interface
       METHOD method of the interface (e.g., static)
       MODE   start if run from ifup, stop if run from ifdown
       PHASE  as per MODE, but with finer granularity, distinguishing the pre-up, post-up, pre-down and post-down phases.
       VERBOSITY indicates whether --verbose was used; set to 1 if so, 0 if not.
       PATH   the command search path: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

       Additionally, all options given in an interface definition stanza are exported to the environment in upper case  with  "IF_"  prepended  and  with
       hyphens converted to underscores and non-alphanumeric characters discarded.

   The manual Method
       This method may be used to define interfaces for which no configuration is done by default. Such interfaces can be configured manually by means of
       up and down commands or /etc/network/if-*.d scripts.

       Options
              (No options)

   The dhcp Method
       This method may be used to obtain an address via DHCP with any of the tools: dhclient, pump, udhcpc, dhcpcd. (They have been listed in their order
       of  precedence.)  If  you  have  a  complicated DHCP setup you should note that some of these clients use their own configuration files and do not
       obtain their configuration information via ifup.

       Options
              hostname hostname
                     Hostname to be requested (pump, dhcpcd, udhcpc)

                     Preferred lease time in hours (pump)

              leasetime leasetime

                     Vendor class identifier (dhcpcd)

              client client
                     Client identifier (dhcpcd, udhcpc)

              hwaddress class address
                     Hardware Address. class is one of ether, ax25, ARCnet or netrom. address is dependent on this choice.

   The bootp Method
       This method may be used to obtain an address via bootp.

       Options
              bootfile file
                     Tell the server to use file as the bootfile.

              server address
                     Use the IP address address to communicate with the server.

              hwaddr addr
                     Use addr as the hardware address instead of whatever it really is.

   The ipv4ll Method
       This method uses avahi-autoipd to configure an interface with an IPv4 Link-Layer address (169.254.0.0/16 family). This method  is  also  known  as
       "APIPA" or "IPAC", and often colloquially referred to as "Zeroconf address".
