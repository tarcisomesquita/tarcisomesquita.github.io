SYNOPSIS

iptables [-t table] -I chain [rulenum] rule-specification [options]
iptables -t filter -I OUTPUT 2 -o eth0 -j DROP

DESCRIPTION
Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.
Several different tables may be defined.
Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.
Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.
What to do is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.
