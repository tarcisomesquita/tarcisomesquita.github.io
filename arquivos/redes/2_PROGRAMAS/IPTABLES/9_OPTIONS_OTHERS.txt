OTHER OPTIONS

-v, --verbose
   Verbose output.  This option makes the  list  command  show  the
   interface  name,  the  rule options (if any), and the TOS masks.
   The packet and byte counters are also listed,  with  the  suffix
   'K',  'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipli-
   ers respectively (but see the -x  flag  to  change  this).   For
   appending,  insertion,  deletion  and  replacement,  this causes
   detailed information on the rule or rules to be printed.

-n, --numeric
   Numeric output.  IP addresses and port numbers will  be  printed
   in  numeric format.  By default, the program will try to display
   them as host names, network names, or services (whenever  appli-
   cable).

-x, --exact
   Expand  numbers.  Display the exact value of the packet and byte
   counters, instead of only the rounded number in  K's  (multiples
   of  1000)  M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M).
   This option is only relevant for the -L command.

--line-numbers
   When listing rules, add line numbers to the  beginning  of  each
   rule, corresponding to that rule's position in the chain.
