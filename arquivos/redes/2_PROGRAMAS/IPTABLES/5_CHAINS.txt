chains:

PREROUTING
Incoming traffic to the machine (including local generated traffic destined to the machine itself) before routing takes place (can be either local or passing traffic).

INPUT
Packet is going to be locally delivered.

FORWARD
All packets that have been routed and were not for local delivery will traverse this chain. (remote generated, remote destination). 

OUTPUT
Locally generated traffic (either local or remote destination). 

POSTROUTING
Routing decision has been made. Packets enter this chain just before handing them off to the hardware. (including locally generating traffic, destined to the machine itself). 


OPTIONS

-L, --list [chain]
List all rules in the selected chain.
If no chain is selected, all chains are listed.
Ex.: iptables -t nat -n -L

-S, --list-rules [chain]
Print all rules in the selected chain.
If no chain is selected, all chains are printed.

-P, --policy chain target
If the end of a built-in chain is reached the target specified by the chain policy determines the fate of the packet.
Only built-in (non-user defined) chains can have policies.
Ex.: iptables -t raw -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

-F, --flush [chain]
Flush (delete all rules in) the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given).

-Z, --zero [chain]
Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains.

-N, --new-chain chain
Create a new user-defined chain by the given name.
Ex.:
iptables -t filter -N internet
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -j internet
iptables -t filter -A internet -s 200.200.200.200 -j DROP

-X, --delete-chain [chain]
Delete the optional user-defined chain specified.
The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain any rules.
If no argument is given, it will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table.

-E, --rename-chain old-chain new-chain
Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.
