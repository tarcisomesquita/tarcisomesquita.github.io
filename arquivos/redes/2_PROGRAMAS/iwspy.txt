#iwspy eth2 15.144.104.4 hw 08:00:0E:21:3A:1F

#iwspy eth2 + hw 08:00:0E:2A:26:FA # add the new addresses at the end of the list

iwspy eth2  # display the list of address


For example, to change the IP address on device eth2, a program (like ifconfig) would make an ioctl call with the following parameters : ``eth2'', SIOCSIFADDR, new address. The structure defining the parameters layout may be found in /usr/include/linux/if.h and the ioctl call (the constant SIOCSIFADDR) is defined in /usr/include/linux/sockios.h.

For the wireless extensions, I've defined a new set of ioctl calls (for example SIOCSIWFREQ to change the frequency). I've also defined the parameters to those calls (see /usr/include/linux/wireless.h). In fact those new calls map closely to the functionality offered by the wireless tools.
