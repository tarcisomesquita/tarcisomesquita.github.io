RUNTIME INTERACTION
       During the execution of Nmap, all key presses are captured. This allows
       you to interact with the program without aborting and restarting it.
       Certain special keys will change options, while any other keys will
       print out a status message telling you about the scan. The convention
       is that lowercase letters increase the amount of printing, and
       uppercase letters decrease the printing. You may also press '?' for
       help.
