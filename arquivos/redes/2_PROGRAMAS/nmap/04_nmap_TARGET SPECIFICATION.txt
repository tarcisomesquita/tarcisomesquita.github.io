TARGET SPECIFICATION
Ex:
nmap scanme.nmap.org, microsoft.com/24, 192.168.10.0/24, 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0-255.1-254

       CIDR notation 192.168.0.0/16 skip any IPs ending with .0 or .255 because they are commonly broadcast addresses.

       IPv6 addresses can only be specified by their fully qualified IPv6 address or hostname.
       CIDR and octet ranges aren't supported for IPv6 because they are rarely useful.

       -iL inputfilename
           Reads target specifications from inputfilename.
           Entries formats accepted (IP address, hostname, CIDR, IPv6, or octet ranges).
           Each entry must be separated by one or more spaces, tabs, or newlines.
           You can specify a hyphen (-) as the filename if you want Nmap to read hosts from standard input.

       -iR num hosts (Choose random targets)
           The num hosts argument tells Nmap how many IPs to generate. Undesirable IPs such as those in certain
           private, multicast, or unallocated address ranges are automatically skipped.

       --exclude host1[,host2[,...]] (Exclude hosts/networks)

       --excludefile exclude_file (Exclude list from file)
