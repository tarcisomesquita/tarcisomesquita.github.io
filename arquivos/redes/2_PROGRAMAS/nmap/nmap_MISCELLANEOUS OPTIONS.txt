MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS

       -6 (Enable IPv6 scanning)

       -A (Aggressive scan options)
           enables OS detection (-O), version scanning (-sV), script scanning (-sC) and traceroute (--traceroute).

       --datadir directoryname (Specify custom Nmap data file location)
           Nmap obtains some special data at runtime in files named
           nmap-service-probes, nmap-services, nmap-protocols, nmap-rpc,
           nmap-mac-prefixes, and nmap-os-db. If the location of any of these
           files has been specified (using the --servicedb or --versiondb
           options), that location is used for that file. After that, Nmap
           searches these files in the directory specified with the --datadir
           option (if any). Any files not found there, are searched for in the
           directory specified by the NMAPDIR environmental variable. Next
           comes ~/.nmap for real and effective UIDs (POSIX systems only) or
           location of the Nmap executable (Win32 only), and then a
           compiled-in location such as /usr/local/share/nmap or
           /usr/share/nmap

       --send-eth (Use raw ethernet sending)

       --send-ip (Send at raw IP level)

       --privileged (Assume that the user is fully privileged)

       -V; --version (Print version number)

       -h; --help (Print help summary page)
