OUTPUT
       -oN filename (normal output)
           Requests that normal output be directed to the given filename.

       -oX filename (XML output)

       -v (Increase verbosity level)
           Increases the verbosity level, causing Nmap to print more
           information about the scan in progress. Open ports are shown as
           they are found and completion time estimates are provided when Nmap
           thinks a scan will take more than a few minutes. Use it twice or
           more for even greater verbosity.

       -d [level] (Increase or set debugging level)
           When even verbose mode doesn't provide sufficient data for you,
           debugging is available to flood you with much more! For example, -d9 sets level nine. That is the
           highest effective level and will produce thousands of lines unless
           you run a very simple scan with very few ports and targets.
           Some lines are self explanatory, but the messages become more obscure as the debug level is increased.

       --packet-trace (Trace packets and data sent and received)
           Causes Nmap to print a summary of every packet sent or received.
           This is often used for debugging, but is also a valuable way for
           new users to understand exactly what Nmap is doing under the
           covers.

       --open (Show only open (or possibly open) ports)
           Sometimes you only care about ports you can actually connect to
           (open ones), and don't want results cluttered with closed,
           filtered, and closed|filtered ports.

       --iflist (List interfaces and routes)

       --resume filename (Resume aborted scan)
           Some extensive Nmap runs take a very long time--on the order of
           days. Such scans don't always run to completion. Restrictions may
           prevent Nmap from being run during working hours, the network could
           go down, the machine Nmap is running on might suffer a planned or
           unplanned reboot, or Nmap itself could crash. The administrator
           running Nmap could cancel it for any other reason as well, by
           pressing ctrl-C. Restarting the whole scan from the beginning may
           be undesirable. Fortunately, if normal (-oN) logs
           were kept, the user can ask Nmap to resume scanning with the target
           it was working on when execution ceased. Simply specify the
           --resume option and pass the normal/grepable output file as its
           argument. No other arguments are permitted. Simply call
           Nmap as nmap --resume logfilename. Nmap will append new results to
           the data files specified in the previous execution.

       --stylesheet path or URL (Set XSL stylesheet to transform XML output)
           Nmap ships with an XSL stylesheet named nmap.xsl for viewing or translating XML output to HTML.

           --stylesheet http://nmap.org/data/nmap.xsl
