Static routing involves manually adding IP routes to the system's routing table, and this is usually done by manipulating the routing table with the route command.
Static routing fails to network outages and failures along the route.

Dynamic routing depends on large networks with multiple possible IP routes from a source to a destination and makes use of special routing protocols, such as the Router Information Protocol (RIP), which handle the automatic adjustments in routing tables that make dynamic routing possible.
routers learn from one another about their existence and available routes.
