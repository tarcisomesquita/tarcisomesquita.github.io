 To list existing routing rules, one can try:

# ip rule list
0:	from all lookup local 
32766:	from all lookup main 
32767:	from all lookup default

Rules are processed in increasing priority (1st) column). In the above case, priority 0 rule instruct the kernel to look for a routing decision inside table named local for traffic comming from any origin. The content of this table can be accessed via:

# ip route list table local


In the case the table does not solve a certain destination address (eg. traffic to another machine in this case), Linux kernel look for the next rule with lower priority (higher priority number) to find out a routing solution. In this case, the next rule is the one with priority 32766, which says to go to table main

 This table contain exactly the same information displayed by the route command:

# route -n

 One can for example, add a rule specifying that traffic from a certain source must be routed using a specific routing table:

# ip rule add type unicast from 192.168.4.0/24 priority 55 table 55

This will instruct the kernel to when it finds traffic coming from 192.168.4.0/24 network, look for a routing solution inside table number 55, with priority 55.
