Master
maintain list of associated Stations. Manages security policies.
In linux, the program hostapd is used for mode master.

Managed
The station is part of the network of a AP after a process of authentication.

Monitor
All incoming packets are handed over to the host computer completely unfiltered. This mode is useful to see what's going on on the network.
With mac80211, it's also possible to transmit packets in monitor mode, which is known as packet injection.

Ad-Hoc
wireless network without a Master Access Point. Can connect two or more computers.

scanning actively: a station begins transmitting 'Probe' frames. When an AP hears a 'Probe' frame, it responds with a 'Probe Response' frame that contains information about the AP. The station collects 'Probe Response' frames from as many APs as possible and then selects an AP.
scanning passively: a station simply listens for traffic from any AP that might be nearby. Again, the station collects information about as many APs as possible and then selects one.
