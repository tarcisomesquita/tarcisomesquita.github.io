physdev
This module matches on the bridge port input and output devices enslaved to a bridge device.
[!] --physdev-in name
Name of a bridge port via which a packet is received (only for packets entering the INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING chains).
If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match.

[!] --physdev-out name
Name of a bridge port via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets entering the FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains).
If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match.
Note that in the nat and mangle OUTPUT chains one cannot match on the bridge output port, however one can in the filter OUTPUT chain.

[!] --physdev-is-in
Matches if the packet has entered through a bridge interface.

[!] --physdev-is-out
Matches if the packet will leave through a bridge interface.

[!] --physdev-is-bridged
Matches if the packet is being bridged and therefore is not being routed.
This is only useful in the FORWARD and POSTROUTING chains.


pkttype
This module matches the link-layer packet type.

[!] --pkt-type {unicast|broadcast|multicast}
