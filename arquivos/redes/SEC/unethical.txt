1. Select a target.
2. Use intermediaries.
3. Penetration testing steps.
• Intelligence gathering
• Active scanning and enumeration
• Fingerprinting
• Select a target system
• Exploiting the uncovered vulnerabilities
• Escalating privileges
4. Preserve access. Installing a rootkit, back door, Trojan.
5. Cover tracks.
• Scrubbing event and audit logs
• Hiding uploaded files
• Hiding the active processes that allow the attacker to regain access
• Disabling messages to security software and system logs to hide malicious processes and actions
6. Harden the system. After taking ownership of a system, an attacker may fix the open vulnerabilities so no other attacker can use the system for other purposes.
