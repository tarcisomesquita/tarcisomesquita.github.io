client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message, then the server sends a DHCPOFFER, then the client sends a DHCPREQUEST, then the server sends a DHCPACK.

If the client thinks it has a valid lease and sends a DHCPREQUEST to initiate or renew that  lease.
The server can send a:
DHCPNAK tell the client it should stop using the address
DHCPACK tell the client to go ahead and use the address for a while.

the client releases its lease by sending a DHCPRELEASE message

before allocating IP to clients, send  an  ICMP  Echo request  message  to  the IP address being allocated.
If no ICMP Echo reply is received within a second, the address is assumed to  be  free.
