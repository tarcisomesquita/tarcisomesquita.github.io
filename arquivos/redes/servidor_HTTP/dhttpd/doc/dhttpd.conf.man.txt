.Dt DHTTPD.CONF 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhttpd.conf
.Nd Configuration file for dhttpd. 
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file consists of several sections. Currently there are three sections. The global section, virtual hosts and QoS.
.Ss Global configuration
Essential. Begins with 
.Sq <global>
and ends with
.Sq </global> . 
Never forget any of these. They may result in the manifestation of the desired behaviour of the authors.
.Bl -tag -width Ds 
.It Sy listen_on
The address on which dhttpd should listen. This may be either a node name, a numeric host address string (i.e., a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or an IPv6 hex address) or one of the words
.Sq any
or
.Sq all .
The latter two have the same effect.
.It Sy port 
An integer.
.It Sy max_connections 
An integer.
.It Sy debug 
An integer. 
.Sq 0
is debugging disabled, 
.Sq 1
or higher turns debugging on, and raised the debug amount information.
.It Sy https_port 
An integer.
.It Sy timeout 
An integer.
.It Sy script_pool
An integer.
.It Sy user 
Any valid user name.
.It Sy jail_root 
A path.
.It Sy mime_file 
A file.
.It Sy perl_bin
Path to your perl interpreter executable. Eg:
.Sq /usr/bin/perl .
.It Sy php_bin
Path to your php interpreter executable. Eg:
.Sq /usr/bin/php .
.It Sy use_large_access_log_buffer
If string is present, access logs will be block buffered, instead of set to be line buffered. Default is line buffered logs.
.It Sy default_mime_type
A string indicating mime type which should be used as default, eg 
.Sq text/plain 
or
.Sq text/html .
.It Sy cache_size
A number to indicate the amount of file descriptors stat information entries to be cached. The default is 32. 
.It Sy max_cache_age
The maximum age of a cache entry in seconds. After this amount of time has been passed, the stat information will be refreshed. Set high for when your files don't change, set low for continuously changing files. Default is 60.
.Bl -hang 
.It Em Note 1 :
This does not effect the execution of CGI files.
.It Em Note 2 :
dhttpd will not notice file changes until this time has passed once a file has been cached!
.El
.El
.Ss Virtual hosts
Essential. Comes in the form of
.Sq <vhost:hostname>
and ending with
.Sq </vhost> .
 

.Bl -hang
.It Em Note :
It is most imperative that you include 
.Sq <vhost:default>  
! 
Forgetting this 
.Em will
result in strange behaviour.
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy index_document 
Any file name.
.It Sy access_log 
Any file name.
.It Sy error_log 
Any file name.
.It Sy document_base
A sub path from 
.Sy jail_root
indicating where
.Sy index_document
and other documents for this vhost reside.
.It Sy log_type
The type of log you want for this vhost. May be
.Sq common ,
.Sq extended
or
.Sq combined .
Defaults to combined.
.El

.Ss Quality of Service
.Bl -hang
.It Em Note :
Support for this must be compiled in.
.El
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy interface_bandwidth 
Any integer. May have 
.Sq K ,
.Sq M
or 
.Sq G
appended for multiplication with 1 000, 1 000 000 or 1 000 000 000, respectively.
.It Sy type 
One of 
.Sq shaper ,
.Sq guaranteed
or
.Sq priority .
Anything else defaults to 
.Sq best effort .
.It Sy intype 
Either 
.Sq wfq
or something else. In the latter case defaults to 
.Sq fq
