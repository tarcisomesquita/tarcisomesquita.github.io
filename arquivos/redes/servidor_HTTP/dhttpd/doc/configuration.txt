Configuration is possible is several ways. 
You can configure several paramets with the command line, but most are settable via
the configuration file. This file can be specified on the command line.

Basic command line options:
-w			Do not separate into the background. You'll loose your
			terminal, and all output will be sent here.
-d			Output all debugging information (Warning: It's a wadload
			of overwhelming information!)
-f <location>		Use this file as configuration file

Some server configurings:
-p <int>		The HTTP portnumber to be used
-s <int>		The HTTPS portnumber to be used, if you specified at compile-
			time that you wanted HTTPS support
-b <int>		The amount of concurrent connections to manage
