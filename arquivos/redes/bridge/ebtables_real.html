<h3><a name="example1">Linux brouting, MAC snat and MAC dnat all in one</a></h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
<p>
This setup and explanation was given by <em>Enrico Ansaloni</em>,
who got things working together with <em>Alessandro Eusebi</em>.
</p>
<h4>Short description</h4>
<p>
Two 802.1Q VLANs, a HP 4000 M switch and a Linux bridge with iptables and ebtables.<br/>
The HP switch is used for VLAN switching. The Linux bridge is used for bridging specific frames and for IP routing.<br/>
Obviously good filtering is required to prevent duplicated traffic.
</p>
<h4>Enrico's story</h4>
<p>
Why I use the Linux bridge: I have to bridge the 2 VLANs to let DEC LAT traffic only
go through, while IP traffic has to go under normal routing decisions:
this is done with ebtables.<br/>
The bridge has 2 IP addresses, one for each VLAN so that routing will
work, in conjuction with iptables eventually to do some traffic
shaping and internal control (allowed tcp ports from inside to
outside etc.)
</p>
<h4>First try: assign the 2 IP addresses to the bridge device (br0)</h4>
<p>
The problem with the HP switch is that it doesn't allow the same MAC
address in 2 different ports which is what happens when I connect the
bridge which has 2 cables - it connects into 2 ports - and has 1 MAC
address; this occurs even if the ports belong to different VLANs: to put
it in another way, the HP VLAN implementation doesn't fully isolate
VLANs but checks for MAC address consistency in the whole switch,
regardless of VLAN settings... instead, the Cisco Catalyst series does
that right but it costs 3 times more and my customer won't pay that much...
</p>
<h4>Second try: use ebtables MAC snat to give the two bridge IP addresses different MAC source addresses</h4>
<p>
so I decided I could try with MAC natting,
and I set up ebtables like this:
</p>
<pre>
ebtables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $INSIDE_IF_NAME -s $DMZ_IF_MAC \
-j snat --to-source $INSIDE_IF_MAC
ebtables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $INSIDE_IF_NAME -d $INSIDE_IF_MAC \
-j dnat --to-destination $DMZ_IF_MAC
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, I'm tying to fool the switch into thinking the bridge
has a different MAC address for each interface: the rule is correct, as
I can see by capturing traffic with ethereal, but there's a problem:
ebtables works at layer 2 only, thus correctly natting MAC address in
the layer 2 ethernet frame; the switch now accepts the natted packets
but the ARP packets are at layer 3 and they keep the original MAC
address as from the linux kernel network stack, so the client's reply is
wrong and never goes through...
</p>
<h4>Third try: use brouting + MAC snat + MAC dnat</h4>
<p>
As stated in the <a href="examples/basic.html">examples</a> section on the ebtables hp, I started with this:
</p>
<pre>
***********************************************************
Bridge table: broute

Bridge chain: BROUTE
Policy: ACCEPT
nr. of entries: 4
1. -p IPV4 -i eth0 -j DROP , count = 47959
2. -p IPV4 -i eth1 -j DROP , count = 47
3. -p ARP -i eth0 -j DROP , count = 371
4. -p ARP -i eth1 -j DROP , count = 141
***********************************************************
</pre>
<p>
But this is not enough... With this rule, IP routing and ARP stuff is perfectly
working for both networks (VLANs) and I can control IP stuff with iptables, but
bridge isn't working yet... that's because of the duplicate MAC in different
VLANs problem of the HP switch: when I use bridging, the same MAC address of the
bridged client appears on two ports, one for each VLAN, and the switch
automatically deactivates the first port! But I solved this issue with ebtables
MAC NAT, like this:
</p>
<pre>
***********************************************************
Bridge table: nat

Bridge chain: PREROUTING
Policy: ACCEPT
nr. of entries: 2
1. -d 10:50:da:e7:18:51 -i eth1 -j dnat --to-dst 0:50:da:e7:18:51 --dnat-target ACCEPT, count = 1260
2. -d 10:10:a4:9b:30:d -i eth0 -j dnat --to-dst 0:10:a4:9b:30:d --dnat-target ACCEPT, count = 1252

Bridge chain: OUTPUT
Policy: ACCEPT
nr. of entries: 0

Bridge chain: POSTROUTING
Policy: ACCEPT
nr. of entries: 2
1. -s 0:50:da:e7:18:51 -o eth1 -j snat --to-src 10:50:da:e7:18:51 --snat-target ACCEPT, count = 1362
2. -s 0:10:a4:9b:30:d -o eth0 -j snat --to-src 10:10:a4:9b:30:d --snat-target ACCEPT, count = 1346
***********************************************************
</pre>
<p>
The MAC addresses you see are two network client, one for each VLAN. When a
client passes the bridge, I have to change his MAC (i change the first 00: with
10:) in order to make the switch happy.<br/>
I did a small script also, so you can specify a list of MAC addresses for each
VLAN. Here's the script:

<h3><a name="example2">Filtering AppleTalk using ebtables</a></h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
<p>
This setup and description was given by <em>Ashok Aiyar</em>. The original website
where he posted this setup is no longer available but the website is archived
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021005010919/ebv.mimnet.northwestern.edu/~aiyar/appletalk-filter.html">here</a>.
The contents were edited to bring the original text, which dates from the Linux 2.4 days, up-to-date.
</p>
<h4>Why filter AppleTalk?</h4>
<p>There are many situations where it is appropriate to
filter AppleTalk.  Here's one of them.  We tunnel/route
AppleTalk between five networks using <a href=
"http://netatalk.sourceforge.net">netatalk</a>.  There are very 
similarly named Tektronix Phaser printers in two of these networks, 
and often print jobs intended for one are unintentionally sent to 
the other.  We would prefer for each of these Phasers to be visible
only in the network in which it is located, and not in all five 
networks.  Unlike <a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/appletalk/cap.html">CAP</a>, 
netatalk does not support filtering.  Therefore, on this page I describe 
one method to add external filters to netatalk, on the basis of the MAC
address associated with an AppleTalk object or node.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to filtering on the basis of 
MAC addresses.  They have the advantage of being more robust because 
AppleTalk node numbers can change with every reboot, while the MAC
address will not.  They have the disadvantage of not being fine-grained;
MAC-based filtering will block all the services associated with the filtered
AppleTalk node.  In general, AppleTalk nodes in our networks are associated 
with a single service.</p>
<h4>Iptables versus Ebtables</h4>
<p>The Linux <a href="http://www.netfilter.org">
netfilter</a> code supports filtering of IPV4, IPV6 and DECnet packets 
on the basis of MAC addresses.  However such filters do not apply to any 
other type of ethernet frame.  So, an <code>iptables</code> rule such as:</p>
<pre>
iptables -I INPUT -m mac --mac-source TE:KP:HA:SE:R8:60 -j DROP
</pre>
<p>results in only IPV4, IPV6 and DECnet packets from that 
source address being dropped.  More to the point, DDP and AARP packets 
from the same source address are not dropped.  <a href=
"http://ebtables.sf.net">Ebtables</a>
appeared to be perfectly suited to filter Ethernet frames on the basis 
of MAC address as well as ethernet protocol type.  However, it only
supports bridge interfaces, and not regular Ethernet interfaces. 
<a href="mailto:bart.de.schuymer@pandora.be">Bart De Schuymer</a>, the
author of ebtables brought to my attention that a Linux bridge interface 
can have just a single Ethernet interface.  Thanks to Bart's generous 
advice, a working Ethernet filtering setup is described below.</p>
<h4>Setting up Ebtables</h4>
<p>To setup a bridge with a single interface, first create
the bridge interface (br0).  Then add the relevant ethernet interface
to the bridge.  Finally, assign to the bridge the IP address previously 
assigned to the ethernet interface. The commands to do this are detailed 
below:</p>
<pre>
brctl addbr br0             # create bridge interface
brctl stp br0 off           # disable spanning tree protocol on br0
brctl addif br0 eth0        # add eth0 to br0
ifconfig br0 aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast aaa.bbb.ccc.255
ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0
route add -net aaa.bbb.ccc.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 br0
route add default gw aaa.bbb.ccc.1 netmask 0.0.0.0 metric 1 br0
</pre>
<p>Now network traffic will be routed through the br0 interface 
rather than the underlying eth0.  <code>Atalkd</code> can be started to route 
AppleTalk between br0 and any other desired interfaces.  Note that 
<code>atalkd.conf</code> has to be modified so that the reference to eth0 is replaced 
with br0.   For example, the <code>atalkd.conf</code> for PC1 shown on my <a href=
"http://www.steubentech.com/~talon/appletalk.html">AppleTalk
tunneling page</a> is modified to:</p>
<pre>
br0  -seed -phase 2 -net 2253  -addr 2253.102  -zone "Microbio-Immun"
tap0 -seed -phase 2 -net 60000 -addr 60000.253 -zone "Microbio-Immun"
tap1 -seed -phase 2 -net 60001 -addr 60001.253 -zone "Microbio-Immun"
tap2 -seed -phase 2 -net 60002 -addr 60002.253 -zone "Microbio-Immun"
tap3 -seed -phase 2 -net 60003 -addr 60003.253 -zone "Microbio-Immun"
</pre>
<p>Verify that AppleTalk routing is working, and then proceed 
to set up Ethernet filters using <code>ebtables</code>. For this the MAC
addresses of the AppleTalk nodes that are not to be routed must be
known.  One simple method of discovering the MAC address is to send 
the AppleTalk object a few <code>aecho</code> packets, and then read the
MAC address from <code>/proc/net/aarp</code>.  A sample <code>ebtables</code> filter is 
shown below:</p>
<pre>
ebtables -P INPUT ACCEPT
ebtables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
ebtables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
ebtables -A INPUT -p LENGTH -s TE:KP:HA:SE:R8:60 -j DROP
</pre>
<p>Currently, <code>ebtables</code> doesn't support filtering
of 802.2 and 802.3 packets such as the DDP and AARP packets used by
AppleTalk.  However all such packets can be dropped on the basis of
the length field &#8211; if I understand Bart de Schuymer's explanation 
correctly.  Therefore in the example above, all ethernet 802.2,
802.3 packets from the node with the MAC address TE:KP:HA:SE:R8:60
are dropped. This includes AppleTalk packets, but not IPV4, and ARP
packets.  This node is left visible in the network in which it is 
located, but not in any networks to which AppleTalk is routed.</p>
<h4>Acknowledgements, Final Comments and Useful Links:</h4>
<p>Bart de Schuymer's advice and patient explanations are
greatly appreciated.  In my experience <code>atalkd</code> bound to the br0 
interface is as stable as <code>atalkd</code> bound to the eth0 interface.  In
addition the MAC address based filters described here work well for their
intended purpose.  While this works, there is a performance penalty
associated with receiving all IP traffic through br0 and not eth0.  This
is because traffic destined for the bridge is queued twice (once more
than normal) &#8211; that's a lot of overhead.  The ebtables <code>broute</code> table
can be used to circumvent this and directly route the traffic entering
the bridge port.  This way it will be queued only once, eliminating the
performance penalty.  In the example above:</p>
<pre>
brctl addbr br0
brctl stp br0 off
brctl addif br0 eth0
ifconfig br0 0.0.0.0
ifconfig eth0 a.b.c.d netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast a.b.c.255
</pre>
<p>The following two ebtables BROUTE table rules should be used:</p>
<pre>
ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p IPv4 -i eth0 --ip-dst a.b.c.d -j DROP
ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p ARP -i eth0 -d MAC_of_eth0 -j DROP
</pre>
<p>Atalkd should still be bound to br0, thus allowing 
AppleTalk to be filtered by ebtables.  As best as I can tell this
configuration eliminates the performance penalty on IP traffic
throughput.  Because we
<a href="http://www.steubentech.com/~talon/appletalk.html">
tunnel AppleTalk</a> through IP, this configuration removes any throughput
penalties in using a bridge interface and ebtables to route AppleTalk.</p>

<h4>Bridge/router configuration</h4>
<pre>
              br0 (192.168.100.254)
           +-------------------------+
           !                         !          192.168.100.253 +------------+

   LAN     +-----------+-------------+            Cable
                       !
                       !    ipsec0
                       /    (192.168.100.254)
                       !
                       v
          Corporate network (192.168.0.0/19)
</pre>
<ul>
<li>eth0 and eth1 without any address.</li>
<li>br0 is built upon eth0 and eth1.</li>
<li>STP is off.</li>
<li>ipsec0 defaults to br0's address.</li>
<li>Default gateway is, of course, 192.168.100.253.</li>
<li>When tunnel is established, route towards 192.168.0.0/19 is created
by freeswan using interface ipsec0. Classical.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stations configuration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Addressing scheme : 192.168.100.0/24.</li>
<li>Default gateway is 192.168.100.253.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Now the challenge</h4>
<ul>
<li>Automatically inject packets, for which the destination address is within the corporate network addressing, to ipsec0.</li>
<li>Keep the other packets going through eth1.</li>
<li>That is: ping www.yahoo.com (Internet access through eth1) must respond, ping 192.168.0.33 (intranet access going through ipsec0) must answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One can ask why being so complicated. It's enough to configure default gateway (or a list a subnet in the routing table) on the stations to point towards  the
br0 address and the router will do its job routing toward intranet or towards Internet.<br/>
Perfectly exact.
</p>
<p>
Yes but imagine you have several dozens of such local stations without DHCP to manage their network configuration<br/>
and you are thousands of miles away. You can simply send the machine, ask someone to plug it in the router and in the hub with the correct cables you've provided.<br/>
That's all.
</p>
<h4>A solution</h4>
<p>
So
</p>
<pre>
ebtables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p ipv4 --ip-dst 192.168.0.0/19 \
-j dnat --to-dst  $MAC_ADDR_OF_IPSEC0 --dnat-target ACCEPT
</pre>
<p>
actually works and is enough for the challenge.
</p>
<p>
A notice on <code>$MAC_ADDR_Of_IPSEC0</code>.<br/>
Since the rule is set before ipsec is launched the mac address of ipsec0 is not set at this time.
This doesn't matter since ipsec0's mac address will be the same as that of the outbound interface that is equal to eth1's mac address.
</p>
<p>
Hence this rule:
</p>
<pre>
ebtables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p ipv4 --ip-dst 192.168.0.0/19 \
-j dnat --to-dst $MAC_ADDR_OF_ETH1 --dnat-target  ACCEPT
</pre>
<p>
Of course that's only the first step. One can then take into account a few other things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>protecting eth1 at the ip level (via iptables) or at the mac level (anti spoofing via ebtables or iptables),</li>
<li>protecting intranet from devices attempting to access the tunnel from eth1,</li>
<li>be sure such mac address is associated with such ip address without using <code>arp -s</code>, using ebtables,</li>
<li>etc, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>ebtables just saved our cookies big time. Here's how it did it:</h4>
<p>
We're a wireless isp and our wireless subscribers all have 
inexpensive soho routers with fixed ip addresses. We recently had to 
change out the hardware at one of our main towers (software upgrades, 
faster cpu, etc etc) and as a result of doing this, we discovered that 
numerous subscribers all of a sudden could not resolve dns. Everyone 
continued to have ping and tcp connectivity, but dns wasn't resolving 
for them. Rebooting their routers would solve the problem, but there's a 
lot of subscribers who depend on this site and we coulnd't possibly call 
them all. After looking over packet dumps, it appears that most of these 
cheap soho routers have a very subtle bug which was responsable for the 
problem - their dns requests were still bearing the old mac address of 
the router, while test pings to them bore the new! (In effect, the 
embedded dns client in the router was not re-arping for the gateway and 
instead using an outdated cache). This is across several brands of 
routers too. So the solution was to install ebtables mac address nat'ing 
so that received frames destined for the old mac addresses would be 
changed to the new address, thus solving the problem site wide.

<h3><a name="example5">Rate shaping</a></h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
<p>
This example was given by <em>Dave Stahr</em> (dave&lt;at&gt;stewireless.com).
</p>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>
I'm running Fedora Core 3 with <code>bridge-utils-0.9.6-2</code> and
<code>ebtables-v2.0.6</code> to rate shape bandwidth for
our wireless subscribers, based on their MAC address. This bridge sits between our core wireless
link and the switch connected to our servers and internet gateway.  A perl script runs out of
cron that connects to our mysql database to create the traffic queues automatically.  I'm not
including that here, but any programmer could figure out how to write their own suited to their
own database, etc, or just write the config by hand for smaller networks.  We're running on a
little 400mhz PentiumII with 128mb RAM and it doesn't even sweat.  We have around 500 customers,
all rate shaped in their own individual queues. This could hypothetically support up to 20,000
individual traffic queues.
</p>
<p>
This is a very simple setup, but in trying to figure out how to do it, I found many unanswered
posts on many web forums by people trying to do this.
</p>
<h4>Bridge configuration</h4>
<p>
This gives us the ability to log in to the bridge, as well as give the bridge the ability to
connect out to our mysql database server, etc:
</p>
<pre>
------------- ifcfg-br0 -------------
DEVICE=br0
ONBOOT=no
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.111.11
NETMASK=255.255.255.0

----------- bridge_up.sh --------------------
#!/bin/bash

ifdown eth0
ifdown eth1

ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 up
ifconfig eth1 0.0.0.0 up

brctl addbr br0

brctl addif br0 eth0
brctl addif br0 eth1

ifconfig br0 up

----------- bridge_down.sh --------------------
#!/bin/bash
 
ifdown eth0
ifdown eth1
ifconfig br0 down
brctl delbr br0
</pre>
<h4>The rate shaping part</h4>
<p>
We're using <code>tc</code> to do the deed. This is
my first attempt at this, so I may be doing some things wrong, especially with the
<code>tc</code> commands - BUT IT WORKS - so I figure, I'll fix it later. You can use
<code>ebtables -L --Lc</code> to see your customer's usage. I dump this out hourly,
adding the <code>-Z</code> option to zero the counters out, then have a perl script
parse that output and dump it into a mysql table where I can make better use of it.
